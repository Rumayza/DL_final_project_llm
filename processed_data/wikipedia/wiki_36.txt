the planet mars has been explored remotely by spacecraft probes sent from earth beginning in the late 20th century have yielded a large increase in knowledge about the martian system focused primarily on understanding its geology and habitability potential engineering interplanetary journeys is complicated and the exploration of mars has experienced a high failure rate especially the early attempts roughly sixty percent of all spacecraft destined for mars failed before completing their missions with some failing before their observations could begin some missions have been met with unexpected success such as the twin mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity which operated for years beyond their specification current status there are two functional rovers on the surface of mars the curiosity and perseverance rovers both operated by the american space agency nasa perseverance was accompanied by the ingenuity helicopter which scouted sites for perseverance to study before the helicopters mission ended in 2024 the zhurong rover part of the tianwen1 mission by the china national space administration cnsa was active until 20 may 2022 when it went into hibernation due to approaching sandstorms and martian winter the rover was expected to awaken from hibernation in december 2022 but as of april 2023 it has not moved and is presumed to be permanently inactive there are seven orbiters surveying the planet mars odyssey mars express mars reconnaissance orbiter maven the trace gas orbiter the hope mars mission and the tianwen1 orbiter which have contributed massive amounts of information about mars thus there are nine total vehicles currently exploring mars 2 rovers and 7 orbiters various mars sample return missions are being planned like nasaesa mars sample return that will pick up the samples currently being collected by the perseverance rover in april 2024 nasa selected several companies to begin studies on providing commercial services to further enable robotic science on mars martian system mars has long been the subject of human interest early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent linear features were ascribed to intelligent design further telescopic observations found two moons phobos and deimos polar ice caps and the feature now known as olympus mons the solar systems tallest mountain the discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet mars is a rocky planet like earth that formed around the same time yet with only half the diameter of earth and a thin atmosphere it has a cold and desertlike surface one way the surface of mars has been categorized is by thirty quadrangles with each quadrangle named for a prominent physiographic feature within that quadrangle launch windows the minimumenergy launch windows for a martian expedition occur at intervals of approximately two years and two months specifically 780 days the planets synodic period with respect to earth in addition the lowest available transfer energy varies on a roughly 16year cycle for example a minimum occurred in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows rising to a peak in the late 1970s and hitting another low in 1986 and 1988 past missions 19601988 starting in 1960 the soviet space program launched a series of probes to mars including the first intended flybys and hard impact landing mars 1962b the first successful flyby of mars was on 1415 july 1965 by nasas mariner 4 on november 14 1971 mariner 9 became the first space probe to orbit another planet when it entered into orbit around mars the amount of data returned by probes increased substantially as technology improved the first to contact the surface were two soviet probes mars 2 lander on november 27 and mars 3 lander on december 2 1971mars 2 failed during descent and mars 3 failed about twenty seconds after the first martian soft landing mars 6 failed during descent but did return some corrupted atmospheric data in 1974 the 1975 nasa launches of the viking program consisted of two orbiters each with a lander that successfully soft landed in 1976 viking 1 remained operational for six years viking 2 for three years the viking landers relayed the first color panoramas of mars the soviet probes phobos 1 and 2 were sent to mars in 1988 to study mars and its two moons with a focus on phobos phobos 1 lost contact on the way to mars phobos 2 while successfully photographing mars and phobos failed before it was set to release two landers to the surface of phobos past missions since 1992 mars has a reputation as a difficult space exploration target just 25 of 55 missions through 2019 or 455 have been fully successful with a further three partially successful and partially failures however of the sixteen missions since 2001 twelve have been successful and eight of these remain operational missions that ended prematurely after phobos 1 and 2 1988 include see probe difficulties section for more details mars observer launched in 1992 mars 96 1996 mars climate orbiter 1999 mars polar lander with deep space 2 1999 nozomi 2003 beagle 2 2003 fobosgrunt with yinghuo1 2011 schiaparelli lander 2016 following the 1993 failure of the mars observer orbiter the nasa mars global surveyor achieved mars orbit in 1997 this mission was a complete success having finished its primary mapping mission in early 2001 contact was lost with the probe in november 2006 during its third extended program spending exactly 10 operational years in space the nasa mars pathfinder carrying a robotic exploration vehicle sojourner landed in the ares vallis on mars in the summer of 1997 returning many images nasas mars odyssey orbiter entered mars orbit in 2001 odysseys gamma ray spectrometer detected significant amounts of hydrogen in the upper metre or so of regolith on mars this hydrogen is thought to be contained in large deposits of water ice the mars express mission of the european space agency esa reached mars in 2003 it carried the beagle 2 lander which was not heard from after being released and was declared lost in february 2004 beagle 2 was located in january 2015 by the hirise camera on nasas mars reconnaissance orbiter mro having landed safely but failed to fully deploy its solar panels and antenna in early 2004 the mars express planetary fourier spectrometer team announced the orbiter had detected methane in the martian atmosphere a potential biosignature esa announced in june 2006 the discovery of aurorae on mars by the mars express in january 2004 the nasa twin mars exploration rovers named spirit mera and opportunity merb landed on the surface of mars both have met and exceeded all their science objectives among the most significant scientific returns has been conclusive evidence that liquid water existed at some time in the past at both landing sites martian dust devils and windstorms have occasionally cleaned both rovers solar panels and thus increased their lifespan spirit rover mera was active until 2010 when it stopped sending data because it got stuck in a sand dune and was unable to reorient itself to recharge its batteries rosetta came within 250 km of mars during its 2007 flyby dawn flew by mars in february 2009 for a gravity assist on its way to investigate vesta and ceres phoenix landed on the north polar region of mars on may 25 2008 its robotic arm dug into the martian soil and the presence of water ice was confirmed on june 20 2008 the mission concluded on november 10 2008 after contact was lost in 2008 the price of transporting material from the surface of earth to the surface of mars was approximately us309000 per kilogram the indian space research organisation isro launched their mars orbiter mission mom on november 5 2013 and it was inserted into mars orbit on september 24 2014 indias isro is the fourth space agency to reach mars after the soviet space program nasa and esa india successfully placed a spacecraft into mars orbit and became the first country to do so in its maiden attempt overview of missions the following entails a brief overview of previous missions to mars oriented towards orbiters and flybys see also mars landing and mars rover early soviet missions 1960s between 1960 and 1969 the soviet union launched nine probes intended to reach mars they all failed three at launch three failed to reach nearearth orbit one during the burn to put the spacecraft into transmars trajectory and two during the interplanetary orbit the mars 1m programs sometimes dubbed marsnik in western media was the first soviet uncrewed spacecraft interplanetary exploration program which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards mars in october 1960 mars 1960a and mars 1960b also known as korabl 4 and korabl 5 respectively after launch the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition so earth parking orbit was not achieved the spacecraft reached an altitude of 120 km before reentry mars 1962a was a mars flyby mission launched on october 24 1962 and mars 1962b an intended first mars lander mission launched in late december of the same year 1962 both failed from either breaking up as they were going into earth orbit or having the upper stage explode in orbit during the burn to put the spacecraft into transmars trajectory the first success mars 1 1962 beta nu 1 an automatic interplanetary spacecraft launched to mars on november 1 1962 was the first probe of the soviet mars probe program to achieve interplanetary orbit mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet at a distance of about 11000 km and take images of the surface as well as send back data on cosmic radiation micrometeoroid impacts and mars magnetic field radiation environment atmospheric structure and possible organic compounds sixtyone radio transmissions were held initially at 2day intervals and later at 5day intervals from which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected on 21 march 1963 when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106760000 km from earth on its way to mars communications ceased due to failure of its antenna orientation system in 1964 both soviet probe launches of zond 1964a on june 4 and zond 2 on november 30 part of the zond program resulted in failures zond 1964a had a failure at launch while communication was lost with zond 2 en route to mars after a midcourse maneuver in early may 1965 in 1969 and as part of the mars probe program the soviet union prepared two identical 5ton orbiters called m69 dubbed by nasa as mars 1969a and mars 1969b both probes were lost in launchrelated complications with the newly developed proton rocket 1970s the ussr intended to have the first artificial satellite of mars beating the planned american mariner 8 and mariner 9 mars orbiters in may 1971 one day after mariner 8 malfunctioned at launch and failed to reach orbit cosmos 419 mars 1971c a heavy probe of the soviet mars program m71 also failed to launch this spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only while the next two probes of project m71 mars 2 and mars 3 were multipurpose combinations of an orbiter and a lander with small skiswalking rovers propm that would be the first planet rovers outside the moon they were successfully launched in midmay 1971 and reached mars about seven months later on november 27 1971 the lander of mars 2 crashlanded due to an onboard computer malfunction and became the first manmade object to reach the surface of mars on 2 december 1971 the mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing but its transmission was interrupted after 145 seconds the mars 2 and 3 orbiters sent back a relatively large volume of data covering the period from december 1971 to march 1972 although transmissions continued through to august by 22 august 1972 after sending back data and a total of 60 pictures mars 2 and 3 concluded their missions the images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps and gave information on the martian gravity and magnetic fields in 1973 the soviet union sent four more probes to mars the mars 4 and mars 5 orbiters and the mars 6 and mars 7 flybylander combinations all missions except mars 7 sent back data with mars 5 being most successful mars 5 transmitted just 60 images before a loss of pressurization in the transmitter housing ended the mission mars 6 lander transmitted data during descent but failed upon impact mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200 km returning one swath of pictures and radio occultation data which constituted the first detection of the nightside ionosphere on mars mars 7 probe separated prematurely from the carrying vehicle due to a problem in the operation of one of the onboard systems attitude control or retrorockets and missed the planet by 1300 kilometres 87106 au mariner program in 1964 nasas jet propulsion laboratory made two attempts at reaching mars mariner 3 and mariner 4 were identical spacecraft designed to carry out the first flybys of mars mariner 3 was launched on november 5 1964 but the shroud encasing the spacecraft atop its rocket failed to open properly dooming the mission three weeks later on november 28 1964 mariner 4 was launched successfully on a 712month voyage to mars mariner 4 flew past mars on july 14 1965 providing the first closeup photographs of another planet the pictures gradually played back to earth from a small tape recorder on the probe showed impact craters it provided radically more accurate data about the planet a surface atmospheric pressure of about 1 of earths and daytime temperatures of 100 c 148 f were estimated no magnetic field or martian radiation belts were detected the new data meant redesigns for then planned martian landers and showed life would have a more difficult time surviving there than previously anticipated nasa continued the mariner program with another pair of mars flyby probes mariner 6 and 7 they were sent at the next launch window and reached the planet in 1969 during the following launch window the mariner program again suffered the loss of one of a pair of probes mariner 9 successfully entered orbit about mars the first spacecraft ever to do so after the launch time failure of its sister ship mariner 8 when mariner 9 reached mars in 1971 it and two soviet orbiters mars 2 and mars 3 found that a planetwide dust storm was in progress the mission controllers used the time spent waiting for the storm to clear to have the probe rendezvous with and photograph phobos when the storm cleared sufficiently for mars surface to be photographed by mariner 9 the pictures returned represented a substantial advance over previous missions these pictures were the first to offer more detailed evidence that liquid water might at one time have flowed on the planetary surface they also finally discerned the true nature of many martian albedo features for example nix olympica was one of only a few features that could be seen during the planetary duststorm revealing it to be the highest mountain volcano to be exact on any planet in the entire solar system and leading to its reclassification as olympus mons viking program the viking program launched viking 1 and viking 2 spacecraft to mars in 1975 the program consisted of two orbiters and two landers these were the second and third spacecraft to successfully land on mars the primary scientific objectives of the lander mission were to search for biosignatures and observe meteorologic seismic and magnetic properties of mars the results of the biological experiments on board the viking landers remain inconclusive with a reanalysis of the viking data published in 2012 suggesting signs of microbial life on mars the viking orbiters revealed that large floods of water carved deep valleys eroded grooves into bedrock and traveled thousands of kilometers areas of branched streams in the southern hemisphere suggest that rain once fell mars pathfinder sojourner rover mars pathfinder was a us spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on mars on july 4 1997 it consisted of a lander and a small 106kilogram 23 lb wheeled robotic rover named sojourner which was the first rover to operate on the surface of mars in addition to scientific objectives the mars pathfinder mission was also a proofofconcept for various technologies such as an airbag landing system and automated obstacle avoidance both later exploited by the mars exploration rovers mars global surveyor after the 1992 failure of nasas mars observer orbiter nasa retooled and launched mars global surveyor mgs mars global surveyor launched on november 7 1996 and entered orbit on september 12 1997 after a year and a half trimming its orbit from a looping ellipse to a circular track around the planet the spacecraft began its primary mapping mission in march 1999 it observed the planet from a lowaltitude nearly polar orbit over the course of one complete martian year the equivalent of nearly two earth years mars global surveyor completed its primary mission on january 31 2001 and completed several extended mission phases until communication was lost in 2007 the mission studied the entire martian surface atmosphere and interior and returned more data about the red planet than all previous mars missions combined the data has been archived and remains available publicly among key scientific findings global surveyor took pictures of gullies and debris flow features that suggest there may be current sources of liquid water similar to an aquifer at or near the surface of the planet similar channels on earth are formed by flowing water but on mars the temperature is normally too cold and the atmosphere too thin to sustain liquid water nevertheless many scientists hypothesize that liquid groundwater can sometimes surface on mars erode gullies and channels and pool at the bottom before freezing and evaporating magnetometer readings showed that the planets magnetic field is not globally generated in the planets core but is localized in particular areas of the crust new temperature data and closeup images of the martian moon phobos showed that its surface is composed of powdery material at least 1 metre 3 feet thick caused by millions of years of meteoroid impacts data from the spacecrafts laser altimeter gave scientists their first 3d views of mars north polar ice cap in january 1999 faulty software uploaded to the vehicle in june 2006 caused the spacecraft to orient its solar panels incorrectly several months later resulting in battery overheating and subsequent failure on november 5 2006 mgs lost contact with earth nasa ended efforts to restore communication on january 28 2007 mars odyssey and mars express in 2001 nasas mars odyssey orbiter arrived at mars its mission is to use spectrometers and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present water and volcanic activity on mars in 2002 it was announced that the probes gammaray spectrometer and neutron spectrometer had detected large amounts of hydrogen indicating that there are vast deposits of water ice in the upper three meters of mars soil within 60 latitude of the south pole on june 2 2003 the european space agencys mars express set off from baikonur cosmodrome to mars the mars express craft consists of the mars express orbiter and the stationary lander beagle 2 the lander carried a digging device and the smallest mass spectrometer created to date as well as a range of other devices on a robotic arm in order to accurately analyze soil beneath the dusty surface to look for biosignatures and biomolecules the orbiter entered mars orbit on december 25 2003 and beagle 2 entered mars atmosphere the same day however attempts to contact the lander failed communications attempts continued throughout january but beagle 2 was declared lost in midfebruary and a joint inquiry was launched by the uk and esa the mars express orbiter confirmed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide ice at the planets south pole while nasa had previously confirmed their presence at the north pole of mars the landers fate remained a mystery until it was located intact on the surface of mars in a series of images from the mars reconnaissance orbiter the images suggest that two of the spacecrafts four solar panels failed to deploy blocking the spacecrafts communications antenna beagle 2 is the first british and first european probe to achieve a soft landing on mars mer opportunity rover spirit rover phoenix lander nasas mars exploration rover mission mer started in 2003 was a robotic space mission involving two rovers spirit mera and opportunity merb that explored the martian surface geology the missions scientific objective was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on mars the mission was part of nasas mars exploration program which includes three previous successful landers the two viking program landers in 1976 and mars pathfinder probe in 1997 rosetta and dawn swingbys the esa rosetta space probe mission to the comet 67pchuryumovgerasimenko flew within 250 km of mars on february 25 2007 in a gravitational slingshot designed to slow and redirect the spacecraft the nasa dawn spacecraft used the gravity of mars in 2009 to change direction and velocity on its way to vesta and tested out dawns cameras and other instruments on mars fobosgrunt on november 8 2011 russias roscosmos launched an ambitious mission called fobosgrunt it consisted of a lander aimed to retrieve a sample back to earth from mars moon phobos and place the chinese yinghuo1 probe in mars orbit the fobosgrunt mission suffered a complete control and communications failure shortly after launch and was left stranded in low earth orbit later falling back to earth the yinghuo1 satellite and fobosgrunt underwent destructive reentry on january 15 2012 finally disintegrating over the pacific ocean mars orbiter mission the mars orbiter mission also called mangalyaan was launched on 5 november 2013 by the indian space research organisation isro it was successfully inserted into martian orbit on 24 september 2014 the mission is a technology demonstrator and as secondary objective it will also study the martian atmosphere this is indias first mission to mars and with it isro became the fourth space agency to successfully reach mars after the soviet union nasa usa and esa europe it was completed in a record low budget of 71 million making it the leastexpensive mars mission to date the mission concluded on september 27 2022 after contact was lost insight and marco in august 2012 nasa selected insight a 425 million lander mission with a heat flow probe and seismometer to determine the deep interior structure of mars insight landed successfully on mars on 26 november 2018 valuable data on the atmosphere surface and the planets interior were gathered by insight insights mission was declared as ended on 21 december 2022 two flyby cubesats called marco were launched with insight on 5 may 2018 to provide realtime telemetry during the entry and landing of insight the cubesats separated from the atlas v booster 15 hours after launch and traveled their own trajectories to mars current missions on 10 march 2006 nasas mars reconnaissance orbiter mro probe arrived in orbit to conduct a twoyear science survey the orbiter began mapping the martian terrain and weather to find suitable landing sites for upcoming lander missions the mro captured the first image of a series of active avalanches near the planets north pole in 2008 the mars science laboratory mission was launched on november 26 2011 and delivered the curiosity rover on the surface of mars on august 6 2012 utc it is larger and more advanced than the mars exploration rovers with a velocity of up to 90 meters per hour 295 feet per hour experiments include a laser chemical sampler that can deduce the composition of rocks at a distance of 7 meters maven orbiter was launched on 18 november 2013 and on 22 september 2014 it was injected into an areocentric elliptic orbit 6200 km 3900 mi by 150 km 93 mi above the planets surface to study its atmosphere mission goals include determining how the planets atmosphere and water presumed to have once been substantial were lost over time the exomars trace gas orbiter arrived at mars in 2016 and deployed the schiaparelli edm lander a test lander schiaparelli crashed on surface but it transmitted key data during its parachute descent so the test was declared a partial success overview of missions mars reconnaissance orbiter the mars reconnaissance orbiter mro is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of mars from orbit the us720 million spacecraft was built by lockheed martin under the supervision of the jet propulsion laboratory launched august 12 2005 and entered mars orbit on march 10 2006 the mro contains a host of scientific instruments such as the hirise camera ctx camera crism and sharad the hirise camera is used to analyze martian landforms whereas crism and sharad can detect water ice and minerals on and below the surface additionally mro is paving the way for upcoming generations of spacecraft through daily monitoring of martian weather and surface conditions searching for future landing sites and testing a new telecommunications system that enable it to send and receive information at an unprecedented bitrate compared to previous mars spacecraft data transfer to and from the spacecraft occurs faster than all previous interplanetary missions combined and allows it to serve as an important relay satellite for other missions curiosity rover the nasa mars science laboratory mission with its rover named curiosity was launched on november 26 2011 and landed on mars on august 6 2012 on aeolis palus in gale crater the rover carries instruments designed to look for past or present conditions relevant to the past or present habitability of mars maven nasas maven is an orbiter mission to study the upper atmosphere of mars it also serves as a communications relay satellite for robotic landers and rovers on the surface of mars maven was launched 18 november 2013 and reached mars on 22 september 2014 trace gas orbiter and edm the exomars trace gas orbiter is an atmospheric research orbiter built in collaboration between esa and roscosmos it was injected into mars orbit on 19 october 2016 to gain a better understanding of methane ch4 and other trace gases present in the martian atmosphere that could be evidence for possible biological or geological activity the schiaparelli edm lander was destroyed when trying to land on the surface of mars hope the united arab emirates launched the hope mars mission in july 2020 on the japanese hiia booster it was successfully placed into orbit on 9 february 2021 it is studying the martian atmosphere and weather tianwen1 and zhurong rover tianwen1 was a chinese mission launched on

planned twinspacecraft nasa mars orbiter mission to study the structure composition variability and dynamics of mars magnetosphere and atmospheric escape processes the escapade orbiters were originally to be launched in 2022 as secondary payloads on a falcon heavy together with the psyche and janus missions but will now be launched on a new glenn the mission is scheduled to launch in q2 for 2025 indias isro plans to send a followup mission to its mars orbiter mission in 2026 it is called mars lander mission and it will consist of an orbiter and a lander as part of the exomars program esa and the roscosmos planned to send the rosalind franklin rover in 2022 to search for evidence of past or present microscopic life on mars the lander that was planned to deliver the rover is called kazachok and it would have performed scientific studies for about 2 years this mission had been delayed indefinitely as a result of the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine in 2024 the mission received additional funding and is now planned for launch in 2028 proposals tianwen3 is a chinese mission to return samples of martian soil to earth the mission would launch in late 2028 with a lander and ascent vehicle and an orbiter and return module launched separately on two rockets the samples would be returned to earth by july 2031 nasaesa mars sample return is a threelaunch architecture concept for a sample return mission which uses a rover to cache small samples a mars ascent stage to send it into orbit and an orbiter to rendezvous with it above mars and take it to earth solarelectric propulsion could allow a one launch sample return instead of three the marsgrunt is a russian mission concept to bring a sample of martian soil to earth mars aerial and ground global intelligent explorer maggie is a proposed compact fixed wing electric aircraft powered by solar energy to fly in the martian atmosphere with vertical takeofflanding vtol capability other future mission concepts include polar probes martian aircraft and a network of small meteorological stations longterm areas of study may include martian lava tubes resource utilization and electronic charge carriers in rocks human mission proposals the human exploration of mars has been an aspiration since the earliest days of modern rocketry robert h goddard credits the idea of reaching mars as his own inspiration to study the physics and engineering of space flight proposals for human exploration of mars have been made throughout the history of space exploration currently there are multiple active plans and programs to put humans on mars within the next ten to thirty years both governmental and private some of which are listed below nasa human exploration by the united states was identified as a longterm goal in the vision for space exploration announced in 2004 by then us president george w bush the planned orion spacecraft would be used to send a human expedition to earths moon by 2020 as a stepping stone to a mars expedition on september 28 2007 nasa administrator michael d griffin stated that nasa aims to put a person on mars by 2037 on december 2 2014 nasas advanced human exploration systems and operations mission director jason crusan and deputy associate administrator for programs james reuthner announced tentative support for the boeing affordable mars mission design including radiation shielding centrifugal artificial gravity intransit consumable resupply and a lander which can return reuthner suggested that if adequate funding was forthcoming the proposed mission would be expected in the early 2030s on october 8 2015 nasa published its official plan for human exploration and colonization of mars they called it journey to mars the plan operates through three distinct phases leading to fully sustained colonization the first stage already underway is the earth reliant phase this phase continues using the international space station until 2024 validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of longduration space missions on the human body the second stage proving ground moves away from earth reliance and ventures into cislunar space for most of its tasks this is when nasa plans to capture an asteroid test deep space habitation facilities and validate the capabilities required for human exploration of mars the last stage the earth independent phase includes longterm missions on the lunar surface which leverage surface habitats that only require routine maintenance and the harvesting of martian resources for fuel water and building materials nasa is still aiming for human missions to mars in the 2030s though earth independence could take decades longer on august 28 2015 nasa funded a yearlong simulation to study the effects of a yearlong mars mission on six scientists the scientists lived in a biodome on a mauna loa mountain in hawaii with limited connection to the outside world and were only allowed outside if they were wearing spacesuits nasas human mars exploration plans have evolved through the nasa mars design reference missions a series of design studies for human exploration of mars in 2017 the focus of nasa shifted to a return to the moon by 2024 with the artemis program a flight to mars could follow after this project spacex the longterm goal of the private corporation spacex is the establishment of routine flights to mars to enable colonization to this end the company is developing starship a spacecraft capable of crew transportation to mars and other celestial bodies along with its booster super heavy in 2017 spacex announced plans to send two uncrewed starships to mars by 2022 followed by two more uncrewed flights and two crewed flights in 2024 neither of these have yet happened as of november 2024 starship is planned to have a payload of at least 100 tonnes and is designed to use a combination of aerobraking and propulsive descent using fuel produced from a mars in situ resource utilization facility as of 2024 the starship development program has seen multiple integrated test flights and is progressing towards full reusability spacexs plans involve the mass manufacturing of starship and initially sustained by resupply from earth and in situ resource utilization on mars until the mars colony reaches full self sustainability any future human mission to mars will likely take place within the optimal mars launch window which occurs every 26 months zubrin mars direct a lowcost human mission proposed by robert zubrin founder of the mars society would use heavylift saturn v class rockets such as the ares v to skip orbital construction leo rendezvous and lunar fuel depots a modified proposal called mars to stay involves not returning the first immigrant explorers immediately if ever see colonization of mars probe difficulties the challenge complexity and length of mars missions have led to many mission failures the high failure rate of missions attempting to explore mars is informally called the mars curse or martian curse the phrase galactic ghoul or great galactic ghoul refers to a fictitious space monster that subsists on a diet of mars probes and is sometimes facetiously used to explain the recurring difficulties two soviet probes were sent to mars in 1988 as part of the phobos program phobos 1 operated normally until an expected communications session on 2 september 1988 failed to occur the problem was traced to a software error which deactivated phobos 1s attitude thrusters causing the spacecrafts solar arrays to no longer point at the sun depleting phobos 1s batteries phobos 2 operated normally throughout its cruise and mars orbital insertion phases on january 29 1989 gathering data on the sun interplanetary medium mars and phobos shortly before the final phase of the mission during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of phobos surface and release two landers one a mobile hopper the other a stationary platform contact with phobos 2 was lost the mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on march 27 1989 the cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the onboard computer just a few years later in 1992 mars observer launched by nasa failed as it approached mars mars 96 an orbiter launched on november 16 1996 by russia failed when the planned second burn of the block d2 fourth stage did not occur following the success of global surveyor and pathfinder another spate of failures occurred in 1998 and 1999 with the japanese nozomi orbiter and nasas mars climate orbiter mars polar lander and deep space 2 penetrators all suffering various fatal errors the mars climate orbiter was noted for mixing up us customary units with metric units causing the orbiter to burn up while entering mars atmosphere the european space agency has also attempted to land two probes on the martian surface beagle 2 a britishbuilt lander that failed to deploy its solar arrays properly after touchdown in december 2003 and schiaparelli which was flown along the exomars trace gas orbiter contact with the schiaparelli edm lander was lost 50 seconds before touchdown it was later confirmed that the lander struck the surface at a high velocity possibly exploding see also mars general notes the diagram includes missions that are active on the surface such as operational rovers and landers as well as probes in mars orbit the diagram does not include missions that are en route to mars or probes that performed a flyby of mars and moved on references
