renewable energy or green energy is energy from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale the most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy wind power and hydropower bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source although this is controversial renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification this has several benefits electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature such as wind power and solar power in contrast controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity bioenergy or geothermal power renewable energy systems have rapidly become more efficient and cheaper over the past 30 years a large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity is now renewable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have seen significant cost reductions over the past decade making them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels in most countries photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest newbuild electricity from 2011 to 2021 renewable energy grew from 20 to 28 of global electricity supply power from the sun and wind accounted for most of this increase growing from a combined 2 to 10 use of fossil energy shrank from 68 to 62 in 2022 renewables accounted for 30 of global electricity generation and are projected to reach over 42 by 2028 many countries already have renewables contributing more than 20 of their total energy supply with some generating over half or even all their electricity from renewable sources the main motivation to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources is to slow and eventually stop climate change which is widely agreed to be caused mostly by greenhouse gas emissions in general renewable energy sources cause much lower emissions than fossil fuels the international energy agency estimates that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 90 of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources renewables also cause much less air pollution than fossil fuels improving public health and are less noisy the deployment of renewable energy still faces obstacles especially fossil fuel subsidies lobbying by incumbent power providers and local opposition to the use of land for renewable installations like all mining the extraction of minerals required for many renewable energy technologies also results in environmental damage in addition although most renewable energy sources are sustainable some are not overview definition renewable energy is usually understood as energy harnessed from continuously occurring natural phenomena the international energy agency defines it as energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed solar power wind power hydroelectricity geothermal energy and biomass are widely agreed to be the main types of renewable energy renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas electricity generation hot waterspace heating transportation and rural offgrid energy services although almost all forms of renewable energy cause much fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels the term is not synonymous with lowcarbon energy some nonrenewable sources of energy such as nuclear powergenerate almost no emissions while some renewable energy sources can be very carbonintensive such as the burning of biomass if it is not offset by planting new plants renewable energy is also distinct from sustainable energy a more abstract concept that seeks to group energy sources based on their overall permanent impact on future generations of humans for example biomass is often associated with unsustainable deforestation role in addressing climate change as part of the global effort to limit climate change most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in practice this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with lowemissions energy sources this much needed process coined as lowcarbon substitutions in contrast to other transition processes including energy additions needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to successfully mitigating climate change at the 2023 united nations climate change conference around threequarters of the worlds countries set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 the european union aims to generate 40 of its electricity from renewables by the same year other benefits renewable energy is more evenly distributed around the world than fossil fuels which are concentrated in a limited number of countries it also brings health benefits by reducing air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels the potential worldwide savings in health care costs have been estimated at trillions of dollars annually intermittency the two most important forms of renewable energy solar and wind are intermittent energy sources they are not available constantly resulting in lower capacity factors in contrast fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time solar energy can only be captured during the day and ideally in cloudless conditions wind power generation can vary significantly not only daytoday but even monthtomonth this poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded leading to power outages in the mediumterm this variability may require keeping some gasfired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby until there is enough energy storage demand response grid improvement andor baseload power from nonintermittent sources in the longterm energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather in optimal weather it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity electrical energy storage electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent sources such as wind power tidal power solar power exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption pumpedstorage hydroelectricity accounts for more than 85 of all grid power storage batteries are increasingly being deployed for storage and grid ancillary services and for domestic storage green hydrogen is a more economical means of longterm renewable energy storage in terms of capital expenditures compared to pumped hydroelectric or batteries mainstream technologies solar energy solar power produced around 13 terrawatthours twh worldwide in 2022 representing 46 of the worlds electricity almost all of this growth has happened since 2010 solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight however the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions geographic location and time of day there are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy solar thermal which converts solar energy into heat and photovoltaics pv which converts it into electricity pv is far more widespread accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022 it is also growing at a much faster rate with 170 gw newly installed capacity in 2021 compared to 25 gw of solar thermal passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building examples include solar chimneys orienting a building to the sun using construction materials that can store heat and designing spaces that naturally circulate air from 2020 to 2022 solar technology investments almost doubled from usd 162 billion to usd 308 billion driven by the sectors increasing maturity and cost reductions particularly in solar photovoltaic pv which accounted for 90 of total investments china and the united states were the main recipients collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013 despite reductions in japan and india due to policy changes and covid19 growth in china the united states and a significant increase from vietnams feedin tariff program offset these declines globally the solar sector added 714 gigawatts gw of solar pv and concentrated solar power csp capacity between 2013 and 2021 with a notable rise in largescale solar heating installations in 2021 especially in china europe turkey and mexico photovoltaics a photovoltaic system consisting of solar cells assembled into panels converts light into electrical direct current via the photoelectric effect pv has several advantages that make it by far the fastestgrowing renewable energy technology it is cheap lowmaintenance and scalable adding to an existing pv installation as demanded arises is simple its main disadvantage is its poor performance in cloudy weather pv systems range from small residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large utilityscale photovoltaic power station a households solar panels can either be used for just that household or if connected to an electrical grid can be aggregated with millions of others the first utilityscale solar power plant was built in 1982 in hesperia california by arco the plant was not profitable and was sold eight years later however over the following decades pv cells became significantly more efficient and cheaper as a result pv adoption has grown exponentially since 2010 global capacity increased from 230 gw at the end of 2015 to 890 gw in 2021 pv grew fastest in china between 2016 and 2021 adding 560 gw more than all advanced economies combined four of the ten biggest solar power stations are in china including the biggest golmud solar park in china solar thermal unlike photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity solar thermal systems convert it into heat they use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver which in turn heats a water reservoir the heated water can then be used in homes the advantage of solar thermal is that the heated water can be stored until it is needed eliminating the need for a separate energy storage system solar thermal power can also be converted to electricity by using the steam generated from the heated water to drive a turbine connected to a generator however because generating electricity this way is much more expensive than photovoltaic power plants there are very few in use today wind power humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 bc until the 20th century it was primarily used to power ships windmills and water pumps today the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines modern utilityscale wind turbines range from around 600 kw to 9 mw of rated power the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and highaltitude sites are preferred locations for wind farms windgenerated electricity met nearly 4 of global electricity demand in 2015 with nearly 63 gw of new wind power capacity installed wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in europe the us and canada and the second largest in china in denmark wind energy met more than 40 of its electricity demand while ireland portugal and spain each met nearly 20 globally the longterm technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or 40 times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome this would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore and likely also industrial use of new types of vawt turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use as offshore wind speeds average 90 greater than that of land offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than landstationed turbines investments in wind technologies reached usd 161 billion in 2020 with onshore wind dominating at 80 of total investments from 2013 to 2022 offshore wind investments nearly doubled to usd 41 billion between 2019 and 2020 primarily due to policy incentives in china and expansion in europe global wind capacity increased by 557 gw between 2013 and 2021 with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19 each year hydropower since water is about 800 times denser than air even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea swell can yield considerable amounts of energy water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90 which is the highest rate in renewable energy there are many forms of water energy historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs which are still popular in developing countries the largest of them are the three gorges dam 2003 in china and the itaipu dam 1984 built by brazil and paraguay small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 mw of power they are often used on small rivers or as a lowimpact development on larger rivers china is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45000 small hydro installations runoftheriver hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir the water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley using channels pipes andor tunnels until it is high above the valley floor whereupon it can be allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine a runofriver plant may still produce a large amount of electricity such as the chief joseph dam on the columbia river in the united states however many runoftheriver hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro plants much hydropower is flexible thus complementing wind and solar in 2021 the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1360 gw only a third of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14000 twhyear has been developed new hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land high cost and lead times from permission process including environmental and risk assessments with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments it is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid where circumstances permit existing dams such as the russell dam built in 1985 may be updated with pump back facilities for pumpedstorage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power because dispatchable power is more valuable than vre countries with large hydroelectric developments such as canada and norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro bioenergy biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms most commonly it refers to plants or plantderived materials as an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or converted to a more energydense biofuel like ethanol wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of 2012 and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention municipal wood waste for instance construction materials or sawdust is also often burned for energy the biggest percapita producers of woodbased bioenergy are heavily forested countries like finland sweden estonia austria and denmark bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if oldgrowth forests are cleared to make way for crop production in particular demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in brazil and indonesia in addition burning biomass still produces carbon emissions although much less than fossil fuels 39 grams of co2 per megajoule of energy compared to 75 gmj for fossil fuels some biomass sources are unsustainable at current rates of exploitation as of 2017 biofuel biofuels are primarily used in transportation providing 35 of the worlds transport energy demand in 2022 up from 27 in 2010 biojet is expected to be important for shortterm reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from longhaul flights aside from wood the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants such as soybean oil and corn oil most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose although used cooking oil accounted for 14 of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015 the biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region maize is the major feedstock in the united states while sugarcane dominates in brazil in the european union where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks china although it produces comparatively much less biofuel uses mostly corn and wheat in many countries biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures there are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche or not yet viable at large scales for instance bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops rather than only the seed as is common today sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates cow dung can be converted into methane there is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel which is attractive because algae is a nonfood resource grows around 20 times faster than most food crops and can be grown almost anywhere geothermal energy geothermal energy is thermal energy heat extracted from the earths crust it originates from several different sources of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the earths interior as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the earth some of the heat is generated near the earths surface in the crust but some also flows from deep within the earth from the mantle and core geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges where the earths hot mantle is more exposed as of 2023 the united states has by far the most geothermal capacity 27 gw or less than 02 of the countrys total energy capacity followed by indonesia and the philippines global capacity in 2022 was 15 gw geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes as is common in iceland or to generate electricity at smaller scales geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 c 86 f allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 c 302 f in some countries electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total such as kenya 43 and indonesia 5 technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available for example enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres 62 mi into the earth breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water in theory this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on earth emerging technologies there are also other renewable energy technologies that are still under development including enhanced geothermal systems concentrated solar power cellulosic ethanol and marine energy these technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization some may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on further breakthroughs from research development and engineering enhanced geothermal systems enhanced geothermal systems egs are a new type of geothermal power which does not require natural hot water reservoirs or steam to generate power most of the underground heat within drilling reach is trapped in solid rocks not in water egs technologies use hydraulic fracturing to break apart these rocks and release the heat they contain which is then harvested by pumping water into the ground the process is sometimes known as hot dry rock hdr unlike conventional geothermal energy extraction egs may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the cost of drilling egs projects have so far primarily been limited to demonstration plants as the technology is capitalintensive due to the high cost of drilling marine energy marine energy also sometimes referred to as ocean energy is the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences technologies to harness the energy of moving water include wave power marine current power and tidal power reverse electrodialysis red is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh water and salty sea water in large power cells most marine energy harvesting technologies are still at low technology readiness levels and not used at large scales tidal energy is generally considered the most mature but has not seen wide deployment the worlds largest tidal power station is on sihwa lake south korea which produces around 550 gigawatthours of electricity per year earth infrared thermal radiation earth emits roughly 1017 w of infrared thermal radiation that flows toward the cold outer space solar energy hits the surface and atmosphere of the earth and produces heat using various theorized devices like emissive energy harvester eeh or thermoradiative diode this energy flow can be converted into electricity in theory this technology can be used during nighttime others algae fuels producing liquid fuels from oilrich fatrich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some systems that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands spacebased solar power there have been numerous proposals for spacebased solar power in which very large satellites with photovoltaic panels would be equipped with microwave transmitters to beam power back to terrestrial receivers a 2024 study by the nasa office of science and technology policy examined the concept and concluded that with current and nearfuture technologies it would be economically uncompetitive water vapor collection of static electricity charges from water droplets on metal surfaces is an experimental technology that would be especially useful in lowincome countries with relative air humidity over 60 nuclear energy breeder reactors could in principle depending on the fuel cycle employed extract almost all of the energy contained in uranium or thorium decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely used oncethrough light water reactors which extract less than 1 of the energy in the actinide metal uranium or thorium mined from the earth the high fuelefficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply energy used in mining and storage of radioactive waste with seawater uranium extraction currently too expensive to be economical there is enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy the worlds energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983s total energy consumption rate thus making nuclear energy effectively a renewable energy in addition to seawater the average crustal granite rocks contain significant quantities of uranium and thorium with which breeder reactors can supply abundant energy for the remaining lifespan of the sun on the main sequence of stellar evolution artificial photosynthesis artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol researchers in this field strived to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that use a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired nontoxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds ie carbohydrates rather than building and sustaining living cells however prominent research faces hurdles sun catalytix a mit spinoff stopped scaling up their prototype fuelcell in 2012 because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight market and industry trends most new renewables are solar followed by wind then hydro then bioenergy investment in renewables especially solar tends to be more effective in creating jobs than coal gas or oil worldwide renewables employ about 12 million people as of 2020 with solar pv being the technology employing the most at almost 4 million however as of february 2024 the worlds supply of workforce for solar energy is lagging greatly behind demand as universities worldwide still produce more workforce for fossil fuels than for renewable energy industries in 2021 china accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity there are 3146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector globally in 2020 there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer the clean energy sectors added about 47 million jobs globally between 2019 and 2022 totaling 35 million jobs by 2022 5 usage by sector or application some studies say that a global transition to 100 renewable energy across all sectors power heat transport and industry is feasible and economically viable one of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles evs despite that and the use of biofuels such as biojet less than 4 of transport energy is from renewables occasionally hydrogen fuel cells are used for heavy transport meanwhile in the future electrofuels may also play a greater role in decarbonizing hardtoabate sectors like aviation and maritime shipping solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries most notably in china which now has 70 of the global total 180 gwth most of these systems are installed on multifamily apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 5060 million households in china worldwide total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households heat pumps provide both heating and cooling and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority renewable thermal energy is also growing rapidly about 10 of heating and cooling energy is from renewables cost comparison the international renewable energy agency irena stated that 86 187 gw of renewable capacity added in 2022 had lower costs than electricity generated from fossil fuels irena also stated that capacity added since 2000 reduced electricity bills in 2022 by at least 520 billion and that in nonoecd countries the lifetime savings of 2022 capacity additions will reduce costs by up to 580 billion 2018 all other values for 2019 growth of renewables the results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as greenhouse gas ghg emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from ghg emissions resulting in climate change a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies in the decade of 20102019 worldwide investment in renewable energy capacity excluding large hydropower amounted to us27 trillion of which the top countries china contributed us818 billion the united states contributed us3923 billion japan contributed us2109 billion germany contributed us1834 billion and the united kingdom contributed us1265 billion this was an increase of over three and possibly four times the equivalent amount invested in the decade of 20002009 no data is available for 20002003 as of 2022 an estimated 28 of the worlds electricity was generated by renewables this is up from 19 in 1990 future projections a december 2022 report by the iea forecasts that over 20222027 renewables are seen growing by almost 2 400 gw in its main forecast equal to the entire installed power capacity of china in 2021 this is an 85 acceleration from the previous five years and almost 30 higher than what the iea forecast in its 2021 report making its largest ever upward revision renewables are set to account for over 90 of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 iea believes that 90 of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources in june 2022 iea executive director fatih birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices make our energy systems more secure and get the world on track to reach our climate goals chinas five year plan to 2025 includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal repowereu the eu plan to escape dependence on fossil russian gas is expected to call for much more green hydrogen after a transitional period renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the worlds energy production in 2018 the risk management firm dnv gl forecasts that the worlds primary energy mix will be split equally between fossil and nonfossil sources by 2050 middle eastern nations are also planning on reducing their reliance fossil fuel many planned green projects will contribute in 26 of energy supply for the region by 2050 achieving emission reductions equal to 11 gt co2year massive renewable energy projects in the middle east mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park in duba uae shuaibah two 2 solar facility in mecca province saudi arabia neom green hydrogen project in neom saudi arabia gulf of suez wind power project in suez egypt alajban solar park in abu dhabi uae demand in july 2014 wwf and the world resources institute convened a discussion among a number of major us companies who had declared their intention to increase their use of renewable energy these discussions identified a number of principles which companies seeking greater access to renewable energy considered important market deliverables these principles included choice between suppliers and between products cost competitiveness longer term fixed price supplies access to thirdparty financing vehicles and collaboration uk statistics released in september 2020 noted that the proportion of demand met from renewables varies from a low of 34 per cent for transport mainly from biofuels to highs of over 20 per cent for other final users which is largely the service and commercial sectors that consume relatively large quantities of electricity and industry in some locations individual households can opt to purchase renewable energy through a consumer green energy program developing countries in kenya the olkaria v geothermal power station is one of the largest in the world the grand ethiopia renaissance dam project incorporates wind turbines once completed moroccos ouarzazate solar power station is projected to provide power to over a million people policy policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion where europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early 2000s most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy the international renewable energy agency irena is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide it aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer irena was formed in 2009 with 75 countries signing the charter of irena as of april 2019 irena has 160 member states the then united nations secretarygeneral ban kimoon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity and in september 2011 he launched the un sustainable energy for all initiative to improve energy access efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy the 2015 paris agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies in 2017 a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy national targets that year existed in 176 countries in addition there is also a wide range of policies at the stateprovincial and local levels some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades many national state and local governments have created green banks a green bank is a quasipublic financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy global and national policies related to renewable energy can be divided based on sectors such as agriculture transport buildings industry climate neutrality net zero emissions by the year 2050 is the main goal of the european green deal for the european union to reach their target of climate neutrality one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 finance the international renewable energy agencys irena 2023 report on renewable energy finance highlights steady investment growth since 2018 usd 348 billion in 2020 a 56 increase from 2019 usd 430 billion in 2021 24 up from 2020 and usd 499 billion in 2022 16 higher this trend is driven by increasing recognition of renewable energys role in mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security along with investor interest in alternatives to fossil fuels policies such as feedin tariffs in china and vietnam have significantly increased renewable adoption furthermore from 2013 to 2022 installation costs for solar photovoltaic pv onshore wind and offshore wind fell by 69 33 and 45 respectively making renewables more costeffective between 2013 and 2022 the renewable energy sector underwent a significant realignment of investment priorities investment in solar and wind energy technologies markedly increased in contrast other renewable technologies such as hydropower including pumped storage hydropower biomass biofuels geothermal and marine energy experienced a substantial decrease in financial investment notably from 2017 to 2022 investment in these alternative renewable technologies declined by 45 falling from usd 35 billion to usd 17 billion in 2023 the renewable energy sector experienced a significant surge in investments particularly in solar and wind technologies totaling approximately usd 200 billiona 75 increase from the previous year the increased investments in 2023 contributed between 1 and 4 to the gdp in key regions including the united states china the european union and india the energy sector receives investments of approximately usd 3 trillion each year with usd 19 trillion directed towards clean energy technologies and infrastructure to meet the targets set in the net zero emissions nze scenario by 2035 this investment must increase to usd 53 trillion per year 15 debates nuclear power proposed as renewable energy geopolitics the geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research many fossilfuel producing countries such as qatar russia saudi arabia and norway are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical losers of the energy transition although some like norway are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may in the long term become stranded assets it has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels conversely nations abundant in renewable resources and the minerals required for renewables technology are expected to gain influence in particular china has become the worlds dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy especially solar panels wind turbines and lithiumion batteries nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters some may produce and export green hydrogen although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050 accounting for almost 50 of total energy consumption up from 22 in 2015 countries with large uninhabited areas such as australia china and many african and middle eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy the production of renewable energy technologies requires rareearth elements with new supply chains countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest analysts consider nigeria angola chad gabon and sudan all countries with a history of military coups to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income a study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems dont need fuel they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction in october 2021 european commissioner for climate action frans timmermans suggested the best answer to the 2021 global energy crisis is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels he said those blaming the european green deal were doing so for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests some critics blamed the european union emissions trading system eu ets and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis european commission president ursula von der leyen said that europe is too reliant on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports according to von der leyen the answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers and crucially with speeding up the transition to clean energy metal and mineral extraction the transition to renewable energy requires increased extraction of certain metals and minerals like all mining this impacts the environment and can lead to environmental conflict wind power requires large amounts of copper and zinc as well as smaller amounts of the rarer metal neodymium solar power is less resourceintensive but still requires significant amounts of aluminum the expansion of electrical grids requires both copper and aluminum batteries which are critical to enable storage of renewable energy use large quantities of copper nickel aluminum and graphite demand for lithium is expected to grow 42fold from 2020 to 2040 demand for nickel cobalt and graphite is expected to grow by a factor of about 2025 for each of the most relevant minerals and metals its mining is dominated by a single country copper in chile nickel in indonesia rare earths in china cobalt in the democratic republic of the congo drc and lithium in australia china dominates processing of all of these recycling these metals after the devices they are embedded in are spent is essential to create a circular economy and ensure renewable energy is sustainable by 2040 recycled copper lithium cobalt and nickel from spent batteries could reduce combined primary supply requirements for these minerals by around 10 a controversial approach is deep sea mining minerals can be collected from new sources like polymetallic nodules lying on the seabed this would damage local biodiversity but proponents point out that biomass on resourcerich seabeds is much scarcer than in the mining regions on land which are often found in vulnerable habitats like rainforests due to cooccurrence of rareearth and radioactive elements thorium uranium and radium rareearth mining results in production of lowlevel radioactive waste in several african countries the green energy transition has created a mining boom causing deforestation and threatening already endangered species conservation areas installations used to produce wind solar and hydropower are an increasing threat to key conservation areas with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas they are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts more than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built and more are under construction in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe the authors team emphasized that their work should not be interpreted as antirenewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions the key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity in 2020 scientists published a world map of areas that contain renewable energy materials as well as estimations of their overlaps with key biodiversity areas remaining wilderness and protected areas the authors assessed that careful strategic planning is needed recycling of solar panels solar panels are recycled to reduce electronic waste and create a source for materials that would otherwise need to be mined but such business is still small and work is ongoing to improve and scaleup the process society and culture public support solar power plants may compete with arable land while onshore wind farms often face opposition due to aesthetic concerns and noise such opponents are often described as nimbys not in my back yard some environmentalists are concerned about fatal collisions of birds and bats with wind turbines although protests against new wind farms occasionally occur around the world regional and national surveys generally find broad support for both solar and wind power communityowned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms a 2011 uk government document stated that projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities this means giving communities both a say and a stake in the 2000s and early 2010s many renewable projects in germany sweden and denmark were owned by local communities particularly through cooperative structures in the years since more installations in germany have been undertaken by large companies but community ownership remains strong in denmark history prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century nearly all energy used was renewable the oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from more than a million years ago the use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water this practice can be traced back some 7000 years to ships in the persian gulf and on the nile from hot springs geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor animal power water power wind in grain crushing windmills and firewood a traditional biomass in 1885 werner siemens commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state wrote in conclusion i would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten max weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his die protestantische ethik und der geist des kapitalismus the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism published in 1905 development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of world war i the importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 scientific american article in the far distant future natural fuels having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race the theory of peak oil was published in 1956 in the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricitygenerating wind turbines appeared solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980 new government spending regulation and policies helped the renewables industry weather the 2009 global financial crisis better than many other sectors in 2022 renewables
