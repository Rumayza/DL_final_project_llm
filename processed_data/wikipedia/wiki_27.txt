coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 is a contagious disease caused by the coronavirus sarscov2 the first known case was identified in wuhan china in december 2019 most scientists believe the sarscov2 virus entered into human populations through natural zoonosis similar to the sarscov1 and merscov outbreaks and consistent with other pandemics in human history social and environmental factors including climate change natural ecosystem destruction and wildlife trade increased the likelihood of such zoonotic spillover the disease quickly spread worldwide resulting in the covid19 pandemic the symptoms of covid19 are variable but often include fever fatigue cough breathing difficulties loss of smell and loss of taste symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus at least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients most 81 develop mild to moderate symptoms up to mild pneumonia while 14 develop severe symptoms dyspnea hypoxia or more than 50 lung involvement on imaging and 5 develop critical symptoms respiratory failure shock or multiorgan dysfunction older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms some complications result in death some people continue to experience a range of effects long covid for months or years after infection and damage to organs has been observed multiyear studies are underway to further investigate the longterm effects of the disease covid19 transmission occurs when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes nose or mouth the risk is highest when people are in close proximity but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances particularly indoors transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus people remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms testing methods for covid19 to detect the viruss nucleic acid include realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr transcriptionmediated amplification and reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification rtlamp from a nasopharyngeal swab several covid19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries many of which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns other preventive measures include physical or social distancing quarantining ventilation of indoor spaces use of face masks or coverings in public covering coughs and sneezes hand washing and keeping unwashed hands away from the face while drugs have been developed to inhibit the virus the primary treatment is still symptomatic managing the disease through supportive care isolation and experimental measures nomenclature during the initial outbreak in wuhan the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and wuhan coronavirus with the disease sometimes called wuhan pneumonia in the past many diseases have been named after geographical locations such as the spanish flu middle east respiratory syndrome and zika virus in january 2020 the world health organization who recommended 2019ncov and 2019ncov acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma the official names covid19 and sarscov2 were issued by the who on 11 february 2020 with covid19 being shorthand for coronavirus disease 2019 the who additionally uses the covid19 virus and the virus responsible for covid19 in public communications symptoms and signs complications complications may include pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards multiorgan failure septic shock and death cardiovascular complications may include heart failure arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation heart inflammation thrombosis particularly venous thromboembolism and endothelial cell injury and dysfunction approximately 2030 of people who present with covid19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury neurologic manifestations include seizure stroke encephalitis and guillainbarr syndrome which includes loss of motor functions following the infection children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome which has symptoms similar to kawasaki disease which can be fatal in very rare cases acute encephalopathy can occur and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with covid19 and have an altered mental status according to the us centers for disease control and prevention pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from covid19 this is because pregnant women with covid19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction fungal infections such as aspergillosis candidiasis cryptococcosis and mucormycosis have been recorded in patients recovering from covid19 cause covid19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 transmission virology severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus it was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in wuhan all structural features of the novel sarscov2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature particularly in rhinolophus sinicus chinese horseshoe bats outside the human body the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble hospital disinfectants alcohols heat povidoneiodine and ultravioletc uvc irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces sarscov2 is closely related to the original sarscov it is thought to have an animal zoonotic origin genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus betacoronavirus in subgenus sarbecovirus lineage b together with two batderived strains it is 96 identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples batcov ratg13 the structural proteins of sarscov2 include membrane glycoprotein m envelope protein e nucleocapsid protein n and the spike protein s the m protein of sarscov2 is about 98 similar to the m protein of bat sarscov maintains around 98 homology with pangolin sarscov and has 90 homology with the m protein of sarscov whereas the similarity is only around 38 with the m protein of merscov sarscov2 variants the many thousands of sarscov2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages the who in collaboration with partners expert networks national authorities institutions and researchers have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking sarscov2 genetic lineages by gisaid nextstrain and pango the expert group convened by the who recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the greek alphabet for example alpha beta delta and gamma giving the justification that they will be easier and more practical to discussed by nonscientific audiences nextstrain divides the variants into five clades 19a 19b 20a 20b and 20c while gisaid divides them into seven l o v s g gh and gr the pango tool groups variants into lineages with many circulating lineages being classed under the b1 lineage several notable variants of sarscov2 emerged throughout 2020 cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in denmark after strict quarantines and the slaughter of all the countrys mink the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in denmark as of 1 february 2021 as of december 2021 there are five dominant variants of sarscov2 spreading among global populations the alpha variant b117 formerly called the uk variant first found in london and kent the beta variant b1351 formerly called the south africa variant the gamma variant p1 formerly called the brazil variant the delta variant b16172 formerly called the india variant and the omicron variant b11529 which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 december on december 19 2023 the who declared that another distinctive variant jn1 had emerged as a variant of interest though the who expected an increase in cases globally particularly for countries entering winter the overall global health risk was considered low pathophysiology the sarscov2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body covid19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract sinuses nose and throat and the lower respiratory tract windpipe and lungs the lungs are the organs most affected by covid19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is most abundant on the surface of type ii alveolar cells of the lungs the virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to connect to the ace2 receptor and enter the host cell respiratory tract following viral entry covid19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways autopsies of people who died of covid19 have found diffuse alveolar damage and lymphocytecontaining inflammatory infiltrates within the lung from the ct scans of covid19 infected lungs white patches were observed containing fluid known as groundglass opacity ggo or simply ground glass this tended to correlate with the clear jelly liquid found in lung autopsies of people who died of covid19 one possibility addressed in medical research is that hyuralonic acid ha could be the leading factor for this observation of the clear jelly liquid found in the lungs in what could be hyuralonic storm in conjunction with cytokine storm nervous system one common symptom loss of smell results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons the involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in covid19 has been reported in many medical publications it is clear that many people with covid19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues the virus is not detected in the central nervous system cns of the majority of covid19 patients with neurological issues however sarscov2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from covid19 but these results need to be confirmed while virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies the exact mechanism by which it invades the cns remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ace2 in the brain the virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the bloodbrain barrier to gain access to the cns possibly within an infected white blood cell research conducted when alpha was the dominant variant has suggested covid19 may cause brain damage later research showed that all variants studied including omicron killed brain cells but the exact cells killed varied by variant it is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent observed individuals infected with covid19 most with mild cases experienced an additional 02 to 2 of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests all effects were more pronounced among older ages gastrointestinal tract the virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ace2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric duodenal and rectal epithelium as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine cardiovascular system the virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system an acute cardiac injury was found in 12 of infected people admitted to the hospital in wuhan china and is more frequent in severe disease rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ace2 receptors in the heart ace2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function a high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism occurs in people transferred to intensive care units with covid19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation as suggested by high ddimer levels caused by blood clots may have a significant role in mortality incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms and ischaemic events strokes within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with covid19 infection may initiate a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body including pulmonary vasoconstriction a possible mechanism in which oxygenation decreases during pneumonia furthermore damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from covid19 covid19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge a low level of blood lymphocytess may result from the virus acting through ace2related entry into lymphocytes kidneys another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys early reports show that up to 30 of hospitalised patients both in china and in new york have experienced some injury to their kidneys including some persons with no previous kidney problems immunopathology although sarscov2 has a tropism for ace2expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract people with severe covid19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation clinical laboratory findings of elevated il2 il6 il7 as well as the following suggest an underlying immunopathology granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsf interferon gammainduced protein 10 ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha mip1alpha tumour necrosis factor tnf indicative of cytokine release syndrome crs interferon alpha plays a complex janusfaced role in the pathogenesis of covid19 although it promotes the elimination of virusinfected cells it also upregulates the expression of ace2 thereby facilitating the sarscov2 virus to enter cells and to replicate a competition of negative feedback loops via protective effects of interferon alpha and positive feedback loops via upregulation of ace2 is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from covid19 additionally people with covid19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards have classical serum biomarkers of crs including elevated creactive protein crp lactate dehydrogenase ldh ddimer and ferritin systemic inflammation results in vasodilation allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart in particular pathogenic gmcsfsecreting t cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory il6secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with covid19 lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy viral and host factors virus proteins multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus the sprotein otherwise known as the spike protein is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ace2 receptors it includes two subunits s1 and s2 s1 determines the virushost range and cellular tropism via the receptorbinding domain s2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the h1 and hr2 which are heptad repeat regions studies have shown that s1 domain induced igg and iga antibody levels at a much higher capacity it is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective covid19 vaccines the m protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients it is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope the n and e protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the hosts immune response host factors human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 hace2 is the host factor that sarscov2 virus targets causing covid19 theoretically the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers arb and ace inhibitors upregulating ace2 expression might increase morbidity with covid19 though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of arb however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes until further data is available guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain the effect of the virus on ace2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration increased blood vessel permeability alveolar wall permeability as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants these effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms however the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome among healthy adults not exposed to sarscov2 about 35 have cd4 t cells that recognise the sarscov2 s protein particularly the s2 subunit and about 50 react to other proteins of the virus suggesting crossreactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses it is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to covid19 host cytokine response the severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm levels of interleukin 1b interferongamma interferoninducible protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with covid19 disease severity treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in covid19 disease a cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in covid19 it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality the storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome blood clotting events such as strokes myocardial infarction encephalitis acute kidney injury and vasculitis the production of il1 il2 il6 tnfalpha and interferongamma all crucial components of normal immune responses inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm the cells of the central nervous system the microglia neurons and astrocytes are also involved in the release of proinflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system and effects of cytokine storms toward the cns are not uncommon pregnancy response there are many unknowns for pregnant women during the covid19 pandemic given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures physiological responses to pregnancy can include immunological the immunological response to covid19 like other viruses depends on a working immune system it adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the foetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy respiratory many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections one of them is the total reduction of the lungs capacity and inability to clear secretions coagulation during pregnancy there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors and the pathogenesis of sarscov2 infection can be implicated the thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women however from the evidence base it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus in addition to the above other clinical studies have proved that sarscov2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways on the one hand there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation on the other hand covid19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy some examples of these could be foetal growth restriction preterm birth and perinatal mortality which refers to the foetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among liveborn children up to seven completed days of life for preterm birth a 2023 review indicates that there appears to be a correlation with covid19 unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with covid19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care babies born to mothers with covid19 are more likely to have breathing problems pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated diagnosis covid19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions along with laboratory testing chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection viral testing the standard methods of testing for presence of sarscov2 are nucleic acid tests which detects the presence of viral rna fragments as these tests detect rna but not infectious virus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited the test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab however a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used results are generally available within hours the who has published several testing protocols for the disease several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection some have been evaluated by public health england and approved for use in the uk the university of oxfords cebm has pointed to mounting evidence that a good proportion of new mild cases and people retesting positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with and have called for an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing in september 2020 the uk government issued guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive sarscov2 rna results during periods of low prevalence when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results imaging chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening bilateral multilobar groundglass opacities with a peripheral asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection subpleural dominance crazy paving lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography ct of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral groundglass opacities without pleural effusions many groups have created covid19 datasets that include imagery such as the italian radiological society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus imaging without confirmation by rrtpcr is of limited specificity in identifying covid19 a large study in china compared chest ct results to pcr and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection it is faster and more sensitive coding in late 2019 the who assigned emergency icd10 disease codes u071 for deaths from labconfirmed sarscov2 infection and u072 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed covid19 without labconfirmed sarscov2 infection pathology the main pathological findings at autopsy are macroscopy pericarditis lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema lung findings minor serous exudation minor fibrin exudation pulmonary oedema pneumocyte hyperplasia large atypical pneumocytes

disseminated intravascular coagulation dic leukoerythroblastic reaction endotheliitis hemophagocytosis heart cardiac muscle cell necrosis liver microvesicular steatosis nose shedding of olfactory epithelium brain infarction kidneys acute tubular damage spleen white pulp depletion prevention preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated staying at home wearing a mask in public avoiding crowded places keeping distance from others ventilating indoor spaces managing potential exposure durations washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands those diagnosed with covid19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the cdc to stay home except to get medical care call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider wear a face mask before entering the healthcare providers office and when in any room or vehicle with another person cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items the first covid19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 december 2020 by the uk medicines regulator mhra it was evaluated for emergency use authorisation eua status by the us fda and in several other countries initially the us national institutes of health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of covid19 before or after exposure to the sarscov2 virus outside the setting of a clinical trial without a vaccine other prophylactic measures or effective treatments a key part of managing covid19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak known as flattening the curve this is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed allowing for better treatment of active cases and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available vaccine face masks and respiratory hygiene indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces the cdc states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of covid19 infection when indoors increasing the rate of air change decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission the who recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols exhaled respiratory particles can buildup within enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation the risk of covid19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice eg exercising shouting singing as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets prolonged exposure to these conditions typically more than 15 minutes leads to higher risk of infection displacement ventilation with large natural inlets can move stale air directly to the exhaust in laminar flow while significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles passive ventilation reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lack controllability and heat recovery displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs the use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air handwashing and hygiene thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required the who also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty before eating and after blowing ones nose when soap and water are not available the cdc recommends using an alcoholbased hand sanitiser with at least 60 alcohol for areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available the who provides two formulations for local production in these formulations the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis glycerol is added as a humectant social distancing social distancing also known as physical distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals methods include quarantines travel restrictions and the closing of schools workplaces stadiums theatres or shopping centres individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home limiting travel avoiding crowded areas using nocontact greetings and physically distancing themselves from others in 2020 outbreaks occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing in the united states the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from covid19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease and poor access to highquality healthcare surface cleaning after being expelled from the body coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days if a person touches the dirty surface they may deposit the virus at the eyes nose or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of covid19 leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air the amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface the temperature and the humidity coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the uv light in sunlight like other enveloped viruses sarscov2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower and when the relative humidity is low 50 on many surfaces including glass some types of plastic stainless steel and skin the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature or even about a week under ideal conditions on some surfaces including cotton fabric and copper the virus usually dies after a few hours the virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on nonporous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation however of the many surfaces tested two with the longest survival times are n95 respirator masks and surgical masks both of which are considered porous surfaces the cdc says that in most situations cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent not disinfecting is enough to reduce risk of transmission the cdc recommends that if a covid19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care all areas such as offices bathrooms common areas shared electronic equipment like tablets touch screens keyboards remote controls and atms used by the ill persons should be disinfected surfaces may be decontaminated with the following 6271 ethanol 50100 isopropanol 01 sodium hypochlorite 05 hydrogen peroxide 0275 povidoneiodine 50200 ppm hypochlorous acid other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used although popular devices require 510 min exposure and may deteriorate some materials over time a datasheet listing the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry including suspension or surface tested kind of surface use dilution disinfectant and inoculum volumes can be seen in the supplementary material of a 2021 foods article selfisolation selfisolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid19 and those who suspect they have been infected health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper selfisolation many governments have mandated or recommended selfquarantine for entire populations the strongest selfquarantine instructions have been issued to those in highrisk groups those who may have been exposed to someone with covid19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to selfquarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure international travelrelated control measures a 2021 cochrane rapid review found that based upon lowcertainty evidence international travelrelated control measures such as restricting crossborder travel may help to contain the spread of covid19 additionally symptomexposurebased screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases while testbased border screening measures may be more effective it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without followup the review concluded that a minimum 10day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of covid19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening treatment prognosis and risk factors the severity of covid19 varies the disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold in 34 of cases 74 for those over age 65 symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation mild cases typically recover within two weeks while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover among those who have died the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks the italian istituto superiore di sanit reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days with seven being hospitalised however people transferred to an icu had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with covid19 are associated with poor prognoses high sodium with a greater risk of death and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support prolonged prothrombin time and elevated creactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of covid19 and with a transfer to icu some early studies suggest 10 to 20 of people with covid19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month a majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report longterm problems including fatigue and shortness of breath on 30 october 2020 who chief tedros adhanom warned that to a significant number of people the covid virus poses a range of serious longterm effects he has described the vast spectrum of covid19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as really concerning they range from fatigue a cough and shortness of breath to inflammation and injury of major organs including the lungs and heart and also neurological and psychologic effects symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue headaches months of complete exhaustion mood swings and other symptoms tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achieving herd immunity by infection rather than vaccination is morally unconscionable and unfeasible in terms of hospital readmissions about 9 of 106000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge the average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit there are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility among these are advanced age above 65 years of age and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes copd heart failure or chronic kidney disease according to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers acting on the same ace2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking air pollution has been correlated with the disease shortterm and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from covid19 preexisting heart and lung diseases and also obesity especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease contributes to an increased health risk of covid19 it is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from sarscov2 one research study that looked into the covid19 infections in hospitalised kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11 men with untreated hypogonadism were 24 times more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted covid19 hypogonad men treated with testosterone were less likely to be hospitalised for covid19 than men who were not treated for hypogonadism genetic risk factors genetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off covid for instance those that do not produce detectable type i interferons or produce autoantibodies against these may get much sicker from covid19 genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations for instance an allele of the dock2 gene dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene is a common risk factor in asian populations but much less common in europe the mutation leads to lower expression of dock2 especially in younger patients with severe covid in fact many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of sarscov2 infections children while very young children have experienced lower rates of infection older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults the cdc reports that in the us roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the icu while a european multinational study of hospitalised children from june 2020 found that about 8 of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care four of the 582 children 07 in the european study died but the actual mortality rate may be substantially lower since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study longterm effects around 10 to 30 of nonhospitalised people with covid19 go on to develop long covid for those that do need hospitalisation the incidence of longterm effects is over 50 long covid is an often severe multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms there are likely various possibly coinciding causes organ damage from the acute infection can explain a part of the symptoms but long covid is also observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent by a variety of mechanisms the lungs are the organs most affected in covid19 in people requiring hospital admission up to 98 of ct scans performed show lung abnormalities after 28 days of illness even if they had clinically improved people with advanced age severe disease prolonged icu stays or who smoke are more likely to have longlasting effects including pulmonary fibrosis overall approximately onethird of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by dlco even in asymptomatic people but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time after severe disease lung function can take anywhere from three months to a year or more to return to previous levels the risks of cognitive deficit dementia psychotic disorders and epilepsy or seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection immunity the immune response by humans to sarscov2 virus occurs as a combination of the cellmediated immunity and antibody production just as with most other infections b cells interact with t cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen since sarscov2 has been in the human population only since december 2019 it remains unknown if the immunity is longlasting in people who recover from the disease the presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection in another study the level of neutralising antibodies fell fourfold one to four months after the onset of symptoms however the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to sarscov2 memory b cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of sarscov2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms as of august 2021 reinfection with covid19 was possible but uncommon the first case of reinfection was documented in august 2020 a systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of may 2021 with the omicron variant as of 2022 reinfections have become common albeit it is unclear how common covid19 reinfections are thought to likely be less severe than primary infections especially if one was previously infected by the same variant mortality several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality these numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing healthcare system quality treatment options time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age sex and overall health the mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group consequently the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population mortality rates are highly correlated to age with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly in fact one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries populations for example the case fatality rate for covid19 is lower in india than in the us since indias younger population represents a larger percentage than in the us case fatality rate the case fatality rate cfr reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval based on johns hopkins university statistics the global deathtocase ratio is 102 6881955676609955 as of 10 march 2023 the number varies by region infection fatality rate a key metric in gauging the severity of covid19 is the infection fatality rate ifr also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk this metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals hence in contrast to the cfr the ifr incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases estimates a december 2020 systematic review and metaanalysis estimated that population ifr during the first wave of the pandemic was about 05 to 1 in many locations including france netherlands new zealand and portugal 1 to 2 in other locations australia england lithuania and spain and exceeded 2 in italy that study also found that most of these differences in ifr reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and agespecific infection rates in particular the metaregression estimate of ifr is very low for children and younger adults eg 0002 at age 10 and 001 at age 25 but increases progressively to 04 at age 55 14 at age 65 46 at age 75 and 15 at age 85 these results were also highlighted in a december 2020 report issued by the who an analysis of those ifr rates indicates that covid19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middleaged adults for whom the infection fatality rate of covid19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza earlier estimates of ifr at an early stage of the pandemic the world health organization reported estimates of ifr between 03 and 1 on 2 july the whos chief scientist reported that the average ifr estimate presented at a twoday who expert forum was about 06 in august the who found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in europe showed ifr estimates converging at approximately 051 firm lower limits of ifrs have been established in a number of locations such as new york city and bergamo in italy since the ifr cannot be less than the population fatality rate after sufficient time however people can get reinfected as of 10 july in new york city with a population of 84 million 23377 individuals 18758 confirmed and 4619 probable have died with covid19 03 of the population antibody testing in new york city suggested an ifr of 09 and 14 in bergamo province 06 of the population has died in september 2020 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported preliminary estimates of agespecific ifrs for public health planning purposes sex differences covid19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries however in a few countries like india nepal vietnam and slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men globally men are more likely to be admitted to the icu and more likely to die one metaanalysis found that globally men were more likely to get covid19 than women there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections ci 51435658 the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported the death rate was 28 for men and 17 for women later reviews in june 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in cfr between genders one review acknowledges the different mortality rates in chinese men suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors smoking which in some countries like china is mainly a male activity is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men sexbased immunological differences lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing comorbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men in europe as of february 2020 57 of the infected people were men and 72 of those died with covid19 were men as of april 2020 the us government is not tracking sexrelated data of covid19 infections research has shown that viral illnesses like ebola hiv influenza and sars affect men and women differently ethnic differences in the us a greater proportion of deaths due to covid19 have occurred among african americans and other minority groups structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in essential occupations such as retail grocery workers public transit employees healthcare workers and custodial staff greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death similar issues affect native american and latino communities on the one hand in the dominican republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality in this latin american territory there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects dominican women with greater emphasis on those of haitian descent according to a us health policy nonprofit 34 of american indian and alaska native people aian nonelderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21 of white nonelderly adults the source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities in the uk a greater proportion of deaths due to covid19 have occurred in those of a black asian and other ethnic minority background more severe impacts upon patients including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation requirements and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via dna analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3 features that are associated with european neanderthal heritage that structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease the findings are from professor svante pbo and researchers he leads at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology and the karolinska institutet this admixture of modern human and neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50000 and 60000 years ago in southern europe comorbidities biological factors immune response and the general behaviour habits can strongly determine the consequences of covid19 most of those who die of covid19 have preexisting underlying conditions including hypertension diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease according to march data from the united states 89 of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions the italian istituto superiore di sanit reported that out of 88 of deaths where medical charts were available 961 of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 34 diseases according to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension 66 of deaths type 2 diabetes 298 of deaths ischaemic heart disease 276 of deaths atrial fibrillation 231 of deaths and chronic renal failure 202 of deaths most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc are moderate or severe asthma preexisting copd pulmonary fibrosis cystic fibrosis evidence stemming from metaanalysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes when someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with covid19 they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms covid19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and amphetamines insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage in august 2020 the cdc issued a caution that tuberculosis tb infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death the who recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases as testing positive for covid19 could not rule out coinfections some projections have estimated that reduced tb detection due to the pandemic could result in 63 million additional tb cases and 14 million tbrelated deaths by 2025 history the virus is thought to be of natural animal origin most likely through spillover infection a jointstudy conducted in early 2021 by the peoples republic of china and the world health organization indicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host there are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing according to articles published in july 2022 in science virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in november 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the huanan wet market in the city of wuhan hubei china doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover earlier phylogenetics estimated that sarscov2 arose in october or november 2019 a phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in guangdong before wuhan most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through natural zoonosis similar to the sarscov1 and merscov outbreaks and consistent with other pandemics in human history according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change several social and environmental factors including climate change natural ecosystem destruction and wildlife trade increased the likelihood of such zoonotic spillover one study made with the support of the european union found climate change increased the likelihood of the pandemic by influencing distribution of bat species available evidence suggests that the sarscov2 virus was originally harboured by bats and spread to humans multiple times from infected wild animals at the huanan seafood market in wuhan in december 2019 a minority of scientists and some members of the us intelligence community believe the virus may have been unintentionally leaked from a laboratory such as the wuhan institute of virology the us intelligence community has mixed views on the issue but overall agrees with the scientific consensus that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and is unlikely to have been genetically engineered there is no evidence sarscov2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic the first confirmed human infections were in wuhan a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed covid19 published in january 2020 in the lancet reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 december 2019 official publications from the who reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 december 2019 humantohuman transmission was confirmed by the who and chinese authorities by 20 january 2020 according to official chinese sources these were mostly linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market which also sold live animals in may 2020 george gao the director of the cdc said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in milan and turin italy on 18 december 2019 by december 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by humantohuman transmission the number of covid19 cases in hubei gradually increased reaching sixty by 20 december and at least 266 by 31 december on 24 december wuhan central hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company vision medicals on 27 and 28 december vision medicals informed the wuhan central hospital and the chinese cdc of the results of the test showing a new coronavirus a pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 december and treated by the doctor zhang jixian in hubei provincial hospital who informed the wuhan jianghan cdc on 27 december on 30 december a test report addressed to wuhan central hospital from company capitalbio medlab stated an erroneous positive result for sars causing a group of doctors at wuhan central hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result the wuhan municipal health commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause that same evening eight of these doctors including li wenliang punished on 3 january were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another ai fen was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm the wuhan municipal health commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 december confirming 27 cases enough to trigger an investigation during the early stages of the outbreak the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days in early and midjanuary 2020 the virus spread to other chinese provinces helped by the chinese new year migration and wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange on 20 january china reported nearly 140 new cases in one day including two people in beijing and one in shenzhen later official data shows 6174 people had already developed symptoms by then and more may have been infected a report in the lancet on 24 january indicated human transmission strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers and said testing for the virus was essential due to its pandemic potential on 30 january the who declared covid19 a public health emergency of international concern by this time the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 january 2020 two tourists from china italy overtook china as the country with the most deaths on 19 march 2020 by 26 march the united states had overtaken china and italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of covid19 cases in new york came from european travellers rather than directly from china or any other asian country retesting of prior samples found a person in france who had the virus on 27 december 2019 and a person in the united states who died from the disease on 6 february 2020 rtpcr testing of untreated wastewater samples from brazil and italy have suggested detection of sarscov2 as early as november and december 2019 respectively but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised many have not been peerreviewed details are often missing and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected a september 2020 review journal article said the possibility that the covid19 infection had already spread to europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant even if partially circumstantial evidence including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in france and italy in november and december as of 1 october 2021 reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to covid19 to have exceeded five million the public health emergency of international concern for covid19 ended on may 5 2023 by this time everyday life in most countries had returned to how it was before the pandemic misinformation after the initial outbreak of covid19 misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin scale prevention treatment and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online in september 2020 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the united states but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood other species humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis some pets especially cats and ferrets can catch this virus from infected humans symptoms in cats include respiratory such as a cough and digestive symptoms cats can spread the virus to other cats and may be able to spread the virus to humans but cattohuman transmission of sarscov2 has not been proven compared to cats dogs are less susceptible to this infection behaviours which increase the risk of transmission include kissing licking and petting the animal the virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs ducks or chickens at all mice rats and rabbits if they can be infected at all are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans as expected monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the covid19 virus minks which are in the same family as ferrets have been infected minks may be asymptomatic and can also spread the virus to humans multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms denmark a major producer of mink pelts ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations following an outbreak referred to as cluster 5 a vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched research international research on vaccines and medicines in covid19 is underway by government organisations academic groups and industry researchers the cdc has classified it to require a bsl3 grade laboratory there has been a great deal of covid19 research involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand as of december 2020 hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken with research happening on every continent except antarctica as of november 2020 more than 200 possible treatments have been studied in humans transmission and prevention research modelling research has been conducted with several objectives including predictions of the dynamics of transmission diagnosis and prognosis of infection estimation of the impact of interventions or allocation of resources modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions several other types of models have been developed and used during the covid19 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of covid19 retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure mobilitydata based models to investigate transmission or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic treatmentrelated research repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into covid19 treatments other candidates in trials include vasodilators corticosteroids immune therapies lipoic acid bevacizumab and recombinant angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 in march 2020 the world health organization who initiated the solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs an experimental drug called remdesivir antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine two antihiv drugs lopinavirritonavir and interferonbeta more than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of april 2020 research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir by may 2020 france italy and belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a covid19 treatment in june initial results from the randomised recovery trial in the united kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen because this is a welltested and widely available treatment it was welcomed by the who which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids based on those preliminary results dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the nih for patients with covid19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with covid19 who do not require supplemental oxygen in september 2020 the who released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for covid19 the who recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical covid19 strong recommendation based on moderate certainty evidence the who suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with nonsevere covid19 conditional recommendation based on low certainty evidence the updated guidance was based on a metaanalysis of clinical trials of critically ill covid19 patients in september 2020 the european medicines agency ema endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms 88 lb who require supplemental oxygen therapy dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion drip into a vein in november 2020 the us food and drug administration fda issued an emergency use authorisation for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mildtomoderate covid19 bamlanivimab is authorised for people with positive results of direct sarscov2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms 88 lb and who are at high risk for progressing to severe covid19 or hospitalisation this includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have chronic medical conditions in february 2021 the fda issued an emergency use authorisation eua for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate covid19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms 88 lb who test positive for sarscov2 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe covid19 the authorised use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions in april 2021 the fda revoked the emergency use authorisation eua that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab when administered alone to be used for the treatment of mildtomoderate covid19 in adults and certain paediatric patients cytokine storm a cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe covid19 a cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly a cytokine storm can lead to ards and multiple organ failure data collected from jin yintan hospital in wuhan china indicates that patients who had more severe responses to covid19 had greater amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses these high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by chinas national health commission after a small study was completed it is undergoing a phase ii nonrandomised trial at the national level in italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm also called cytokine storm syndrome not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome it is meant to counter such developments which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people the interleukin6 receptor il6r antagonist was approved by the fda to undergo a phase iii clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on covid19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroidrefractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause car t cell therapy in 2017 there is no randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for crs prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum il6 levels by saturating the il6r driving il6 across the bloodbrain barrier and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of crs lenzilumab an antigmcsf monoclonal antibody is protective in murine models for car t cellinduced crs and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic gmcsf secreting t cells in hospitalised patients with covid19 passive antibodies transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from covid19 to people who need them is being investigated as a nonvaccine method of passive immunisation viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against sarscov2 the spike protein of sarscov2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies as of 8 august 2020 eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of sarscov2 have entered clinical studies it has been proposed that selection of broadneutralising antibodies against sarscov2 and sarscov might be useful for treating not only covid19 but also future sarsrelated cov infections other mechanisms however such as antibodydependant cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis may be possible other forms of passive antibody therapy for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies are in development the use of passive antibodies to treat people with active covid19 is also being studied this involves the production of convalescent serum which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus which is then administered to active patients this strategy was tried for sars with inconclusive results an updated cochrane review in may 2023 found high certainty evidence that for the treatment of people with moderate to severe covid19 convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement there continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with covid19 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy bioethics since the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic scholars have explored the bioethics normative economics and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies the socioeconomic inequalities between genders races groups with disabilities communities regions countries and continents have also drawn
