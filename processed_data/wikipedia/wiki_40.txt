genomics is an interdisciplinary field of molecular biology focusing on the structure function evolution mapping and editing of genomes a genome is an organisms complete set of dna including all of its genes as well as its hierarchical threedimensional structural configuration in contrast to genetics which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organisms genes their interrelations and influence on the organism genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules in turn proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput dna sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discoverybased research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain the field also includes studies of intragenomic within the genome phenomena such as epistasis effect of one gene on another pleiotropy one gene affecting more than one trait heterosis hybrid vigour and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome history etymology from the greek gen gene gamma epsilon nu epsilon meaning become create creation birth and subsequent variants genealogy genesis genetics genic genomere genotype genus etc while the word genome from the german genom attributed to hans winkler was in use in english as early as 1926 the term genomics was coined by tom roderick a geneticist at the jackson laboratory bar harbor maine over beers with jim womack tom shows and stephen obrien at a meeting held in maryland on the mapping of the human genome in 1986 first as the name for a new journal and then as a whole new science discipline early sequencing efforts following rosalind franklins confirmation of the helical structure of dna james d watson and francis cricks publication of the structure of dna in 1953 and fred sangers publication of the amino acid sequence of insulin in 1955 nucleic acid sequencing became a major target of early molecular biologists in 1964 robert w holley and colleagues published the first nucleic acid sequence ever determined the ribonucleotide sequence of alanine transfer rna extending this work marshall nirenberg and philip leder revealed the triplet nature of the genetic code and were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments in 1972 walter fiers and his team at the laboratory of molecular biology of the university of ghent ghent belgium were the first to determine the sequence of a gene the gene for bacteriophage ms2 coat protein fiers group expanded on their ms2 coat protein work determining the complete nucleotidesequence of bacteriophage ms2rna whose genome encodes just four genes in 3569 base pairs bp and simian virus 40 in 1976 and 1978 respectively dnasequencing technology developed in addition to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin frederick sanger and his colleagues played a key role in the development of dna sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects in 1975 he and alan coulson published a sequencing procedure using dna polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the plus and minus technique this involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3 termini these could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualised using autoradiography the procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement but was still very laborious nevertheless in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5386 nucleotides of the singlestranded bacteriophage x174 completing the first fully sequenced dnabased genome the refinement of the plus and minus method resulted in the chaintermination or sanger method see below which formed the basis of the techniques of dna sequencing genome mapping data storage and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quartercentury of research in the same year walter gilbert and allan maxam of harvard university independently developed the maxamgilbert method also known as the chemical method of dna sequencing involving the preferential cleavage of dna at known bases a less efficient method for their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids gilbert and sanger shared half the 1980 nobel prize in chemistry with paul berg recombinant dna complete genomes the advent of these technologies resulted in a rapid intensification in the scope and speed of completion of genome sequencing projects the first complete genome sequence of a eukaryotic organelle the human mitochondrion 16568 bp about 166 kb kilobase was reported in 1981 and the first chloroplast genomes followed in 1986 in 1992 the first eukaryotic chromosome chromosome iii of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae 315 kb was sequenced the first freeliving organism to be sequenced was that of haemophilus influenzae 18 mb megabase in 1995 the following year a consortium of researchers from laboratories across north america europe and japan announced the completion of the first complete genome sequence of a eukaryote s cerevisiae 121 mb and since then genomes have continued being sequenced at an exponentially growing pace as of october 2011 the complete sequences are available for 2719 viruses 1115 archaea and bacteria and 36 eukaryotes of which about half are fungi most of the microorganisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced are problematic pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae which has resulted in a pronounced bias in their phylogenetic distribution compared to the breadth of microbial diversity of the other sequenced species most were chosen because they were wellstudied model organisms or promised to become good models yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been an important model organism for the eukaryotic cell while the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster has been a very important tool notably in early premolecular genetics the worm caenorhabditis elegans is an often used simple model for multicellular organisms the zebrafish brachydanio rerio is used for many developmental studies on the molecular level and the plant arabidopsis thaliana is a model organism for flowering plants the japanese pufferfish takifugu rubripes and the spotted green pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis are interesting because of their small and compact genomes which contain very little noncoding dna compared to most species the mammals dog canis familiaris brown rat rattus norvegicus mouse mus musculus and chimpanzee pan troglodytes are all important model animals in medical research a rough draft of the human genome was completed by the human genome project in early 2001 creating much fanfare this project completed in 2003 sequenced the entire genome for one specific person and by 2007 this sequence was declared finished less than one error in 20000 bases and all chromosomes assembled in the years since then the genomes of many other individuals have been sequenced partly under the auspices of the 1000 genomes project which announced the sequencing of 1092 genomes in october 2012 completion of this project was made possible by the development of dramatically more efficient sequencing technologies and required the commitment of significant bioinformatics resources from a large international collaboration the continued analysis of human genomic data has profound political and social repercussions for human societies the omics revolution the englishlanguage neologism omics informally refers to a field of study in biology ending in omics such as genomics proteomics or metabolomics the related suffix ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields such as the genome proteome or metabolome lipidome respectively the suffix ome as used in molecular biology refers to a totality of some sort similarly omics has come to refer generally to the study of large comprehensive biological data sets while the growth in the use of the term has led some scientists jonathan eisen among others to claim that it has been oversold it reflects the change in orientation towards the quantitative analysis of complete or nearcomplete assortment of all the constituents of a system in the study of symbioses for example researchers which were once limited to the study of a single gene product can now simultaneously compare the total complement of several types of biological molecules genome analysis after an organism has been selected genome projects involve three components the sequencing of dna the assembly of that sequence to create a representation of the original chromosome and the annotation and analysis of that representation sequencing historically sequencing was done in sequencing centers centralized facilities ranging from large independent institutions such as joint genome institute which sequence dozens of terabases a year to local molecular biology core facilities which contain research laboratories with the costly instrumentation and technical support necessary as sequencing technology continues to improve however a new generation of effective fast turnaround benchtop sequencers has come within reach of the average academic laboratory on the whole genome sequencing approaches fall into two broad categories shotgun and highthroughput or nextgeneration sequencing shotgun sequencing shotgun sequencing is a sequencing method designed for analysis of dna sequences longer than 1000 base pairs up to and including entire chromosomes it is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding quasirandom firing pattern of a shotgun since gel electrophoresis sequencing can only be used for fairly short sequences 100 to 1000 base pairs longer dna sequences must be broken into random small segments which are then sequenced to obtain reads multiple overlapping reads for the target dna are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence shotgun sequencing is a random sampling process requiring oversampling to ensure a given nucleotide is represented in the reconstructed sequence the average number of reads by which a genome is oversampled is referred to as coverage for much of its history the technology underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chaintermination method or sanger method which is based on the selective incorporation of chainterminating dideoxynucleotides by dna polymerase during in vitro dna replication recently shotgun sequencing has been supplanted by highthroughput sequencing methods especially for largescale automated genome analyses however the sanger method remains in wide use primarily for smallerscale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous dna sequence reads 500 nucleotides chaintermination methods require a singlestranded dna template a dna primer a dna polymerase normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates dntps and modified nucleotides dideoxyntps that terminate dna strand elongation these chainterminating nucleotides lack a 3oh group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides causing dna polymerase to cease extension of dna when a ddntp is incorporated the ddntps may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in dna sequencers typically these machines can sequence up to 96 dna samples in a single batch run in up to 48 runs a day highthroughput sequencing the high demand for lowcost sequencing has driven the development of highthroughput sequencing technologies that parallelize the sequencing process producing thousands or millions of sequences at once highthroughput sequencing is intended to lower the cost of dna sequencing beyond what is possible with standard dyeterminator methods in ultrahighthroughput sequencing as many as 500000 sequencingbysynthesis operations may be run in parallel the illumina dye sequencing method is based on reversible dyeterminators and was developed in 1996 at the geneva biomedical research institute by pascal mayer and laurent farinelli in this method dna molecules and primers are first attached on a slide and amplified with polymerase so that local clonal colonies initially coined dna colonies are formed to determine the sequence four types of reversible terminator bases rtbases are added and nonincorporated nucleotides are washed away unlike pyrosequencing the dna chains are extended one nucleotide at a time and image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment allowing for very large arrays of dna colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity with an optimal configuration the ultimate throughput of the instrument depends only on the ad conversion rate of the camera the camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides then the dye along with the terminal 3 blocker is chemically removed from the dna allowing the next cycle an alternative approach ion semiconductor sequencing is based on standard dna replication chemistry this technology measures the release of a hydrogen ion each time a base is incorporated a microwell containing template dna is flooded with a single nucleotide if the nucleotide is complementary to the template strand it will be incorporated and a hydrogen ion will be released this release triggers an isfet ion sensor if a homopolymer is present in the template sequence multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single flood cycle and the detected electrical signal will be proportionally higher assembly sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments of a much longer dna sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence this is needed as current dna sequencing technology cannot read whole genomes as a continuous sequence but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 1000 bases depending on the technology used third generation sequencing technologies such as pacbio or oxford nanopore routinely generate sequencing reads 10100 kb in length however they have a high error rate at approximately 1 percent typically the short fragments called reads result from shotgun sequencing genomic dna or gene transcripts ests assembly approaches assembly can be broadly categorized into two approaches de novo assembly for genomes which are not similar to any sequenced in the past and comparative assembly which uses the existing sequence of a closely related organism as a reference during assembly relative to comparative assembly de novo assembly is computationally difficult nphard making it less favourable for shortread ngs technologies within the de novo assembly paradigm there are two primary strategies for assembly eulerian path strategies and overlaplayoutconsensus olc strategies olc strategies ultimately try to create a hamiltonian path through an overlap graph which is an nphard problem eulerian path strategies are computationally more tractable because they try to find a eulerian path through a debruijn graph finishing finished genomes are defined as having a single contiguous sequence with no ambiguities representing each replicon annotation the dna sequence assembly alone is of little value without additional analysis genome annotation is the process of attaching biological information to sequences and consists of three main steps identifying portions of the genome that do not code for proteins identifying elements on the genome a process called gene prediction and attaching biological information to these elements automatic annotation tools try to perform these steps in silico as opposed to manual annotation aka curation which involves human expertise and potential experimental verification ideally these approaches coexist and complement each other in the same annotation pipeline also see below traditionally the basic level of annotation is using blast for finding similarities and then annotating genomes based on homologues more recently additional information is added to the annotation platform the additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation some databases use genome context information similarity scores experimental data and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their subsystems approach other databases eg ensembl rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline structural annotation consists of the identification of genomic elements primarily orfs and their localisation or gene structure functional annotation consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements sequencing pipelines and databases the need for reproducibility and efficient management of the large amount of data associated with genome projects mean that computational pipelines have important applications in genomics research areas functional genomics functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects such as genome sequencing projects to describe gene and protein functions and interactions functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription translation and proteinprotein interactions as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as dna sequence or structures functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of dna at the levels of genes rna transcripts and protein products a key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genomewide approach to these questions generally involving highthroughput methods rather than a more traditional genebygene approach a major branch of genomics is still concerned with sequencing the genomes of various organisms but the knowledge of full genomes has created the possibility for the field of functional genomics mainly concerned with patterns of gene expression during various conditions the most important tools here are microarrays and bioinformatics structural genomics structural genomics seeks to describe the 3dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome this genomebased approach allows for a highthroughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches the principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome rather than focusing on one particular protein with fullgenome sequences available structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches especially because the availability of large numbers of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allow scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modelingbased approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure as opposed to traditional structural biology the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often but not always comes before anything is known regarding the protein function this raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics ie determining protein function from its 3d structure epigenomics epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell known as the epigenome epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cells dna or histones that affect gene expression without altering the dna sequence russell 2010 p 475 two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are dna methylation and histone modification epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiationdevelopment and tumorigenesis the study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic highthroughput assays metagenomics metagenomics is the study of metagenomes genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples the broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics ecogenomics or community genomics while traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing rely upon cultivated clonal cultures early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes often the 16s rrna gene to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivationbased methods recent studies use shotgun sanger sequencing or massively parallel pyrosequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities because of its power to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world model systems viruses and bacteriophages bacteriophages have played and continue to play a key role in bacterial genetics and molecular biology historically they were used to define gene structure and gene regulation also the first genome to be sequenced was a bacteriophage however bacteriophage research did not lead the genomics revolution which is clearly dominated by bacterial genomics only very recently has the study of bacteriophage genomes become prominent thereby enabling researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying phage evolution bacteriophage genome sequences can be obtained through direct sequencing of isolated bacteriophages but can also be derived as part of microbial genomes analysis of bacterial genomes has shown that a substantial amount of microbial dna consists of prophage sequences and prophagelike elements a detailed database mining of these sequences offers insights into the role of prophages in shaping the bacterial genome overall this method verified many known bacteriophage groups making this a useful tool for predicting the relationships of prophages from bacterial genomes cyanobacteria at present there are 24 cyanobacteria for which a total genome sequence is available 15 of these cyanobacteria come from the marine environment these are six prochlorococcus strains seven marine synechococcus strains trichodesmium erythraeum ims101 and crocosphaera watsonii wh8501 several studies have demonstrated how these sequences could be used very successfully to infer important ecological and physiological characteristics of marine cyanobacteria however there are many more genome projects currently in progress amongst those there are further prochlorococcus and marine synechococcus isolates acaryochloris and prochloron the n2fixing filamentous cyanobacteria nodularia spumigena lyngbya aestuarii and lyngbya majuscula as well as bacteriophages infecting marine cyanobaceria thus the growing body of genome information can also be tapped in a more general way to address global problems by applying a comparative approach some new and exciting examples of progress in this field are the identification of genes for regulatory rnas insights into the evolutionary origin of photosynthesis or estimation of the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the genomes that have been analyzed applications genomics has provided applications in many fields including medicine biotechnology anthropology and other social sciences genomic medicine nextgeneration genomic technologies allow clinicians and biomedical researchers to drastically increase the amount of genomic data collected on large study populations when combined with new informatics approaches that integrate many kinds of data with genomic data in disease research this allows researchers to better understand the genetic bases of drug response and disease early efforts to apply the genome to medicine included those by a stanford team led by euan ashley who developed the first tools for the medical interpretation of a human genome the genomes2people research program at brigham and womens hospital broad institute and harvard medical school was established in 2012 to conduct empirical research in translating genomics into health brigham and womens hospital opened a preventive genomics clinic in august 2019 with massachusetts general hospital following a month later the all of us research program aims to collect genome sequence data from 1 million participants to become a critical component of the precision medicine research platform and the uk biobank initiative has studied more than 500000 individuals with deep genomic and phenotypic data synthetic biology and bioengineering the growth of genomic knowledge has enabled increasingly sophisticated applications of synthetic biology in 2010 researchers at the j craig venter institute announced the creation of a partially synthetic species of bacterium mycoplasma laboratorium derived from the genome of mycoplasma genitalium population and conservation genomics population genomics has developed as a popular field of research where genomic sequencing methods are used to conduct largescale comparisons of dna sequences among populations beyond the limits of genetic markers such as shortrange pcr products or microsatellites traditionally used in population genetics population genomics studies genomewide effects to improve our understanding of microevolution so that we may learn the phylogenetic history and demography of a population population genomic methods are used for many different fields including evolutionary biology ecology biogeography conservation biology and fisheries management similarly landscape genomics has developed from landscape genetics to use genomic methods to identify relationships between patterns of environmental and genetic variation conservationists can use the information gathered by genomic sequencing in order to better evaluate genetic factors key to species conservation such as the genetic diversity of a population or whether an individual is heterozygous for a recessive inherited genetic disorder by using genomic data to evaluate the effects of evolutionary processes and to detect patterns in variation throughout a given population conservationists can formulate plans to aid a given species without as many variables left unknown as those unaddressed by standard genetic approaches see also references further reading external links learn all about genetics online
