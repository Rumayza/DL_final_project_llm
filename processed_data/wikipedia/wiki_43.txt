a fossil fuel is a carbon compound or hydrocarboncontaining material formed naturally in the earths crust from the buried remains of prehistoric organisms animals plants or planktons a process that occurs within geological formations reservoirs of such compound mixtures such as coal petroleum and natural gas can be extracted and burnt as a fuel for human consumption to provide energy for direct use such as for cooking heating or lighting to power heat engines such as steam or internal combustion engines that can propel vehicles or to generate electricity via steam turbine generators some fossil fuels are further refined into derivatives such as kerosene gasoline and diesel or converted into petrochemicals such as polyolefins plastics aromatics and synthetic resins the origin of fossil fuels is the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms whose organic molecules were produced by photosynthetic carbon fixation and sequesteredbiomagnified by the food web creating an underground carbon sink the conversion from these organic materials to highcarbon fossil fuels typically requires a geological process of millions of years due to the length of time it takes nature to form them fossil fuels are considered nonrenewable resources in 2022 over 80 of primary energy consumption in the world and over 60 of its electricity supply were from fossil fuels the largescale burning of fossil fuels causes serious environmental damage over 70 of the greenhouse gas emissions due to human activity in 2022 was carbon dioxide co2 released from burning fossil fuels natural carbon cycle processes on earth mostly absorption by the ocean can remove only a small part of this and terrestrial vegetation loss due to deforestation land degradation and desertification further compounds this deficiency therefore there is a net increase of many billion tonnes of atmospheric co2 per year although methane leaks are significant 52 the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming and ocean acidification additionally most air pollution deaths are due to fossil fuel particulates and noxious gases and it is estimated that this costs over 3 of the global gross domestic product and that fossil fuel phaseout will save millions of lives each year recognition of the climate crisis pollution and other negative impacts caused by fossil fuels has led to a widespread policy transition and activist movement focused on ending their use in favor of renewable and sustainable energy because the fossilfuel industry is so heavily integrated in the global economy and heavily subsidized this transition is expected to have significant economic impacts many stakeholders argue that this change needs to be a just transition and create policy that addresses the societal burdens created by the stranded assets of the fossil fuel industry international policy in the form of united nations sustainable development goals for affordable and clean energy and climate action as well as the paris climate agreement is designed to facilitate this transition at a global level in 2021 the international energy agency concluded that no new fossil fuel extraction projects could be opened if the global economy and society wants to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and meet international goals for climate change mitigation origin the theory that fossil fuels formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in earths crust over millions of years was first introduced by andreas libavius in his 1597 alchemia alchymia and later by mikhail lomonosov as early as 1757 and certainly by 1763 the first use of the term fossil fuel occurs in the work of the german chemist caspar neumann in english translation in 1759 the oxford english dictionary notes that in the phrase fossil fuel the adjective fossil means obtained by digging found buried in the earth which dates to at least 1652 before the english noun fossil came to refer primarily to longdead organisms in the early 18th century aquatic phytoplankton and zooplankton that died and sedimented in large quantities under anoxic conditions millions of years ago began forming petroleum and natural gas as a result of anaerobic decomposition over geological time this organic matter mixed with mud became buried under further heavy layers of inorganic sediment the resulting high temperature and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter first into a waxy material known as kerogen which is found in oil shales and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis despite these heatdriven transformations the energy released in combustion is still photosynthetic in origin terrestrial plants tended to form coal and methane many of the coal fields date to the carboniferous period of earths history terrestrial plants also form type iii kerogen a source of natural gas although fossil fuels are continually formed by natural processes they are classified as nonrenewable resources because they take millions of years to form and known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are generated importance fossil fuels have been important to human development because they can be readily burned in the open atmosphere to produce heat the use of peat as a domestic fuel predates recorded history coal was burned in some early furnaces for the smelting of metal ore while semisolid hydrocarbons from oil seeps were also burned in ancient times they were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming commercial exploitation of petroleum began in the 19th century natural gas once flaredoff as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production is now considered a very valuable resource natural gas deposits are also the main source of helium heavy crude oil which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil and oil sands where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay began to become more important as sources of fossil fuel in the early 2000s oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen a complex mixture of highmolecular weight organic compounds which yield synthetic crude oil when heated pyrolyzed with additional processing they can be employed instead of other established fossil fuels during the 2010s and 2020s there was disinvestment from exploitation of such resources due to their high carbon cost relative to more easilyprocessed reserves prior to the latter half of the 18th century windmills and watermills provided the energy needed for work such as milling flour sawing wood or pumping water while burning wood or peat provided domestic heat the widescale use of fossil fuels coal at first and petroleum later in steam engines enabled the industrial revolution at the same time gas lights using natural gas or coal gas were coming into wide use the invention of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles and trucks greatly increased the demand for gasoline and diesel oil both made from fossil fuels other forms of transportation railways and aircraft also require fossil fuels the other major use for fossil fuels is in generating electricity and as feedstock for the petrochemical industry tar a leftover of petroleum extraction is used in the construction of roads the energy for the green revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers natural gas pesticides oil and hydrocarbonfueled irrigation the development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth it has been estimated that almost half of the earths population are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use according to head of a fertilizers commodity price agency 50 of the worlds food relies on fertilisers environmental effects the burning of fossil fuels has a number of negative externalities harmful environmental impacts where the effects extend beyond the people using the fuel these effects vary between different fuels all fossil fuels release co2 when they burn thus accelerating climate change burning coal and to a lesser extent oil and its derivatives contributes to atmospheric particulate matter smog and acid rain air pollution from fossil fuels in 2018 has been estimated to cost us29 trillion or 33 of the global gross domestic product gdp climate change is largely driven by the release of greenhouse gases like co2 and the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of these emissions in most parts of the world climate change is negatively impacting ecosystems this includes contributing to the extinction of species and reducing peoples ability to produce food thus adding to the problem of world hunger continued rises in global temperatures will lead to further adverse effects on both ecosystems and people the world health organization has said that climate change is the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century combustion of fossil fuels generates sulfuric and nitric acids which fall to earth as acid rain impacting both natural areas and the built environment monuments and sculptures made from marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable as the acids dissolve calcium carbonate fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials mainly uranium and thorium which are released into the atmosphere in 2000 about 12000 tonnes of thorium and 5000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal it is estimated that during 1982 us coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the three mile island accident burning coal also generates large amounts of bottom ash and fly ash these materials are used in a wide variety of applications see fly ash reuse utilizing for example about 40 of the united states production in addition to the effects that result from burning the harvesting processing and distribution of fossil fuels also have environmental effects coal mining methods particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining have negative environmental impacts and offshore oil drilling poses a hazard to aquatic organisms fossil fuel wells can contribute to methane release via fugitive gas emissions oil refineries also have negative environmental impacts including air and water pollution coal is sometimes transported by dieselpowered locomotives while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships requiring the combustion of additional fossil fuels a variety of mitigating efforts have arisen to counter the negative effects of fossil fuels this includes a movement to use alternative energy sources such as renewable energy environmental regulation uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions for example rules against releasing waste products like fly ash into the atmosphere in december 2020 the united nations released a report saying that despite the need to reduce greenhouse emissions various governments are doubling down on fossil fuels in some cases diverting over 50 of their covid19 recovery stimulus funding to fossil fuel production rather than to alternative energy the un secretary general antnio guterres declared that humanity is waging war on nature this is suicidal nature always strikes back and it is already doing so with growing force and fury he also claimed there is still cause for hope anticipating the us plan to join other large emitters like china and the eu in adopting targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050 inflation effects fossilflation is a term that describes the impact of fossil fuels on inflation according to vox in august 2022 economists have pointed to energy prices as the main reason for high inflation noting that energy prices indirectly affect virtually every part of the economy sectors that raise prices significantly as a result of higher fossil fuel prices include transportation food and shipping history mark zandi of moodys says that fossil fuel prices have driven every big episode of inflation since wwii the economic impact of the russian invasion of ukraine in 2022 was a major recent example of fossil fuels causing inflation some economists including isabel schnabel believe that dependence on fossil fuels is the main driver of the 20212022 inflation spike efforts to combat fossilflation gernot wagner argues that commodities are undesirable energy sources because they are susceptible to volatile price swings that technologies like renewable energy are not he also argues that technologies improve and get relatively cheaper over time coming out of the covid19 pandemic some argued for the possibility of a base effect phenomenon due to cheaper than normal prices such as for oil at the onset of the pandemic followed by aboveaverage prices which exacerbated the perceived inflation inflation reduction act while not expected to provide much shortterm relief the inflation reduction act seeks to make the united states less dependent on fossil fuels and their ability to cause inflation in the economy moodys estimates that by 2030 the bill could reduce the typical american households spending on energy by more than 300 each year in 2022 dollars illness and deaths environmental pollution from fossil fuels impacts humans because particulates and other air pollution from fossil fuel combustion may cause illness and death when inhaled these health effects include premature death acute respiratory illness aggravated asthma chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function the poor undernourished very young and very old and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health are more at risk global air pollution deaths due to fossil fuels have been estimated at over 8 million people 2018 nearly 1 in 5 deaths worldwide at 102 million 2019 and 513 million excess deaths from ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use 2023 while all energy sources inherently have adverse effects the data show that fossil fuels cause the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions and are the most dangerous for human health in contrast modern renewable energy sources appear to be safer for human health and cleaner the death rates from accidents and air pollution in the eu are as follows per terawatthour twh as the data shows coal oil natural gas and biomass cause higher death rates and higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions than hydropower nuclear energy wind and solar power scientists propose that 18 million lives have been saved by replacing
