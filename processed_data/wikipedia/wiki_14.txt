a selfdriving car also known as a autonomous car ac driverless car robotaxi robotic car or robocar is a car that is capable of operating with reduced or no human input selfdriving cars are responsible for all driving activities such as perceiving the environment monitoring important systems and controlling the vehicle which includes navigating from origin to destination as of late 2024 no system has achieved full autonomy sae level 5 in december 2020 waymo was the first to offer rides in selfdriving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas sae level 4 and as of april 2024 offers services in arizona phoenix and california san francisco and los angeles in june 2024 after a waymo selfdriving taxi crashed into a utility pole in phoenix arizona all 672 of its jaguar ipace were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole like items and had their software updated in july 2021 deeprouteai started offering selfdriving taxi rides in shenzhen china starting in february 2022 cruise offered selfdriving taxi service in san francisco but suspended service in 2023 in 2021 honda was the first manufacturer to sell an sae level 3 car followed by mercedesbenz in 2023 history experiments have been conducted on advanced driver assistance systems adas since at least the 1920s the first adas system was cruise control which was invented in 1948 by ralph teetor trials began in the 1950s the first semiautonomous car was developed in 1977 by japans tsukuba mechanical engineering laboratory it required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer the vehicle reached speeds of 30 kmh 19 mph with the support of an elevated rail carnegie mellon universitys navlab and alv semiautonomous projects launched in the 1980s funded by the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa starting in 1984 and mercedesbenz and bundeswehr university munichs eureka prometheus project in 1987 by 1985 alv had reached 31 kmh 19 mph on twolane roads obstacle avoidance came in 1986 and day and night offroad driving by 1987 in 1995 navlab 5 completed the first autonomous us coasttocoast journey traveling from pittsburgh pennsylvania and san diego california 982 of the trip was autonomous it completed the trip at an average speed of 638 mph 1027 kmh until the second darpa grand challenge in 2005 automated vehicle research in the united states was primarily funded by darpa the us army and the us navy yielding incremental advances in speeds driving competence controls and sensor systems the us allocated us650 million in 1991 for research on the national automated highway system which demonstrated automated driving combining highwayembedded automation with vehicle technology and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure the programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 partly funded by the national automated highway system and darpa navlab drove 4584 km 2848 mi across the us in 1995 4501 km 2797 mi or 98 autonomously in 2015 delphi piloted a delphi technologybased audi over 5472 km 3400 mi through 15 states 99 autonomously in 2015 nevada florida california virginia michigan and washington dc allowed autonomous car testing on public roads from 2016 to 2018 the european commission funded development for connected and automated driving through coordination actions cartre and scout programs the strategic transport research and innovation agenda stria roadmap for connected and automated transport was published in 2019 in november 2017 waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver however an employee was in the car to handle emergencies in march 2018 elaine herzberg became the first reported pedestrian killed by a selfdriving car an uber test vehicle with a human backup driver prosecutors did not charge uber while the human driver was sentenced to probation in december 2018 waymo was the first to commercialize a robotaxi service in phoenix arizona in october 2020 waymo launched a robotaxi service in a geofenced part of the area the cars were monitored in realtime and remote engineers intervened to handle exceptional conditions in march 2019 ahead of roborace robocar set the guinness world record as the worlds fastest autonomous car robocar reached 28242 kmh 17549 mph in march 2021 honda began leasing in japan a limited edition of 100 legend hybrid ex sedans equipped with level 3 traffic jam pilot driving technology which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under 30 kilometres per hour 19 mph in december 2020 waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public in a part of phoenix arizona nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in california in 2021 deeprouteai launched robotaxi service in shenzhen in july 2021 in december 2021 mercedesbenz received approval for a level 3 car in february 2022 cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public in san francisco in december 2022 several manufacturers scaled back plans for selfdriving technology including ford and volkswagen in 2023 cruise suspended its robotaxi service nuro was approved for level 4 in palo alto in august 2023 as of august 2023 vehicles operating at level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor as of early 2024 honda leases a level 3 car in japan and mercedes sells two level 3 cars in germany california and nevada definitions organizations such as sae have proposed terminology standards however most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed names such as autonodrive pilotassist fullself driving or drivepilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names despite offering a system it called full selfdriving tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks in the united kingdom a fully selfdriving car is defined as a car so registered rather than one that supports a specific feature set the association of british insurers claimed that the usage of the word autonomous in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think autonomous and autopilot imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself even though they do not automated driving system sae identified 6 levels for driving automation from level 0 to level 5 an ads is an sae j3016 level 3 or higher system advanced driver assistance system an adas is a system that automates specific driving features such as forward collision warning fcw automatic emergency braking aeb lane departure warning ldw lane keeping assistance lka or blind spot warning bsw an adas requires a human driver to handle tasks that the adas does not support autonomy versus automation autonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver automation is functionspecific handling issues such as speed control but leaves broader decisionmaking to the driver euro ncap defined autonomous as the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident in europe the words automated and autonomous can be used together for instance regulation eu 20192144 supplied automated vehicle means a vehicle that can move without continuous driver supervision but that driver intervention is still expected or required in the operational design domains odd fully automated vehicle means a vehicle that can move entirely without driver supervision cooperative system a remote driver is a driver that operates a vehicle at a distance using a video and data connection according to sae j3016 some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and selfsufficiently but if they depend on communication andor cooperation with outside entities they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous operational design domain vendors have taken a variety of approaches to the selfdriving problem teslas approach is to allow their full selfdriving fsd system to be used in all odds as a level 2 handson eyeson adas waymo picked specific odds city streets in phoenix and san francisco for their level 5 robotaxi service mercedes benz offers level 3 service in las vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to 40 miles per hour 64 kmh mobileyes supervision system offers handsoffeyeson driving on all road types at speeds up to 130 kilometres per hour 81 mph gms handsfree super cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions stopping or returning control to the driver when odd changes in 2024 the company announced plans to expand road coverage from 400000 miles to 750000 miles fords bluecruise handsoff system operates on 130000 miles of us divided highways selfdriving the union of concerned scientists defined selfdriving as cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle also known as autonomous or driverless cars they combine sensors and software to control navigate and drive the vehicle the british automated and electric vehicles act 2018 law defines a vehicle as driving itself if the vehicle is not being controlled and does not need to be monitored by an individual another british government definition stated selfdriving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves british definitions in british english the word automated alone has several meanings such as in the sentence thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety going on to say they cannot therefore be classed as automated driving preferring assisted driving the first occurrence of the automated word refers to an unece automated system while the second refers to the british legal definition of an automated vehicle british law interprets the meaning of automated vehicle based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle driving itself and an insured vehicle in november 2023 the british government introduced the automated vehicles bill it proposed definitions for related terms selfdriving a vehicle satisfies the selfdriving test if it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously and it is capable of doing so by means of that feature safely and legally autonomy a vehicle travels autonomously if it is controlled by the vehicle and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene control control of vehicle motion safe a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard legal a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction sae classification a sixlevel classification system ranging from fully manual to fully automated was published in 2014 by sae international as j3016 taxonomy and definitions for terms related to onroad motor vehicle automated driving systems the details are revised occasionally this classification is based on the role of the driver rather than the vehicles capabilities although these are related after sae updated its classification in 2016 j3016201609 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa adopted the sae standard the classification is a topic of debate with various revisions proposed classifications a driving mode aka driving scenario combines an odd with matched driving requirements eg expressway merging traffic jam cars may switch levels in accord with the driving mode above level 1 level differences are related to how responsibility for safe movement is dividedshared between adas and driver rather than specific driving features sae automation levels have been criticized for their technological focus it has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better which may not be the case sae levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure and road user behavior mobileye system mobileye ceo amnon shashua and cto shai shalevshwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems claiming that a more consumerfriendly approach was needed its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved while not formally committing to it eyesonhandson the first level handsoneyeson implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle but is supervised by the system which intervenes according to the features it supports eg adaptive cruise control automatic emergency braking the driver is entirely responsible with hands on the wheel and eyes on the road eyesonhandsoff eyesonhandsoff allows the driver to let go of the wheel the system drives the driver monitors and remains prepared to resume control as needed eyesoffhandsoff eyesoffhandsoff means that the driver can stop monitoring the system leaving the system in full control eyesoff requires that no errors be reproducible not triggered by exotic transitory conditions or frequent that speeds are contextually appropriate eg 80 mph on limitedaccess roads and that the system handle typical maneuvers eg getting cut off by another vehicle the automation level could vary according to the road eg eyesoff on freeways eyeson on side streets no driver the highest level does not require a human driver in the car monitoring is done either remotely telepresence or not at all safety a critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a minimum risk maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention technology architecture the perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle the road traffic traffic controls and other observable objects and their relative motion the control system then takes actions to move the vehicle considering the local model road map and driving regulations several classifications have been proposed to describe adas technology one proposal is to adopt these categories navigation path planning perception and car control navigation navigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems some systems use basic maps relying on perception to deal with anomalies such a map understands which roads lead to which others whether a road is a freeway a highway are oneway etc other systems require highly detailed maps including lane maps obstacles traffic controls etc perception acs need to be able to perceive the world around them supporting technologies include combinations of cameras lidar radar audio and ultrasound gps and inertial measurement deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories some systems use bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping slam algorithms another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects datmo used to handle potential obstacles other systems use roadside realtime locating system rtls technologies to aid localization teslas vision only system uses eight cameras without lidar or radar to create its birdseye view of the environment path planning path planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination techniques used for path planning include graphbased search and variationalbased optimization techniques graphbased techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicleobstacle variationalbased optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicles path to prevent collisions the large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram an occupancy grid mapping or a driving corridor algorithm the latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers maps maps are necessary for navigation map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other with details such as oneway vs twoway to those that are highly detailed with information about lanes traffic controls roadworks and more researchers at the mitcomputer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail developed a system called maplite which allows selfdriving cars to drive with simple maps the system combines the gps position of the vehicle a sparse topological map such as openstreetmap which has only 2d road features with sensors that observe road conditions one issue with highlydetailed maps is updating them as the world changes vehicles that can operate with lessdetailed maps do not require frequent updates or geofencing sensors sensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment sensor types include cameras lidar ultrasound and radar control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to crosscheck each other to correct errors for example radar can image a scene in eg a nighttime snowstorm that defeats cameras and lidar albeit at reduced precision after experimenting with radar and ultrasound tesla adopted a visiononly approach asserting that humans drive using only vision and that cars should be able to do the same while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types by contrast waymo makes use of the higher resolution of lidar sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology drive by wire drive by wire is the use of electrical or electromechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages driver monitoring driver monitoring is used to assess the drivers attention and alertness techniques in use include eye monitoring and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel it attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors vehicle communication vehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic road obstacles to receive map and software updates etc isotc 22 specifies invehicle transport information and control systems while isotc 204 specifies information communication and control systems in surface transport international standards have been developed for adas functions connectivity human interaction invehicle systems managementengineering dynamic map and positioning privacy and security rather than communicating among vehicles they can communicate with roadbased systems to receive similar information software update software controls the vehicle and can provide entertainment and other services overtheair updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center in march 2021 the unece regulation on software update and software update management systems was published safety model a safety model is software that attempts to formalize rules that ensure that acs operate safely ieee is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as ieee p2846 a formal model for safety considerations in automated vehicle decision making in 2022 a research group at national institute of informatics nii japan enhanced mobileyes reliable safety system as goalaware rss to enable rss rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic notification the us has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously it will be used in the 2026 mercedesbenz eqs and sclass sedans with drive pilot an sae level 3 driving system as of 2023 the turquoise light had not been standardized by the prc or the unece artificial intelligence artificial intelligence ai plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles avs enabling them to perceive their surroundings make decisions and navigate safely without human intervention ai algorithms empower avs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors such as cameras lidar radar and gps to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time challenges obstacles the primary obstacle to acs is the advanced software and mapping required to make them work safely across the wide variety of conditions that drivers experience in addition to handling daynight driving in good and bad weather on roads of arbitrary quality acs must cope with other vehicles road obstacles poormissing traffic controls flawed maps and handle endless edge cases such as following the instructions of a police officer managing traffic at a crash site other obstacles include cost liability consumer reluctance ethical dilemmas security privacy and legalregulatory framework further avs could automate the work of professional drivers eliminating many jobs which could slow acceptance concerns deceptive marketing tesla calls its level 2 adas full selfdriving fsd beta us senators richard blumenthal and edward markey called on the federal trade commission ftc to investigate this marketing in 2021 in december 2021 in japan mercedesbenz was punished by the consumer affairs agency for misleading product descriptions mercedesbenz was criticized for a misleading us commercial advertising eclass models at that time mercedesbenz rejected the claims and stopped its selfdriving car ad campaign that had been running in august 2022 the california department of motor vehicles dmv accused tesla of deceptive marketing practices with the automated vehicles bill avb selfdriving carmakers could face prison for misleading adverts in the unitedkingdom security in the 2020s concerns over acs vulnerability to cyberattacks and data theft emerged espionage in 2018 and 2019 former apple engineers were charged with stealing information related to apples selfdriving car project in 2021 the united states department of justice doj accused chinese security officials of coordinating a hacking campaign to steal information from government entities including research related to autonomous vehicles china has prepared the provisions on management of automotive data security trial to protect its own data cellular vehicletoeverything technologies are based on 5g wireless networks as of november 2022 the us congress was considering the possibility that imported chinese ac technology could facilitate espionage testing of chinese automated cars in the us has raised concern over which us data are collected by chinese vehicles to be stored in chinese country and concern with any link with the chinese communist party driver communications acs complicate the need for drivers to communicate with each other eg to decide which car enters an intersection first in an ac without a driver traditional means such as hand signals do not work no driver no hands behavior prediction acs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles pedestrians etc in real time in order to proceed safely the task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior one approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity handover the adas has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver trust consumers will avoid acs unless they trust them as safe robotaxis operating in san francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks automatic elevators were invented in 1900 but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button however with repeated use of autonomous driving functions drivers behavior and trust in autonomous vehicles gradually improved and both entered a more stable state at the same time this also improved the performance and reliability of the vehicle in complex conditions thereby increasing public trust economics autonomous also present various political and economic implications the transportation sector holds significant sway in many the political and economic landscapes for instance many us states generates much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes the advent of selfdriving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams furthermore the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions data from the us bureau of labor statistics indicates that in 2019 the sector employed over two million individuals as tractortrailer truck drivers additionally taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately 370400 positions and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over 680000 collectively this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly 29 million jobs surpassing the job losses experienced in the 2008 great recession equity and inclusion the prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle av development potentially perpetuating existing inequalities there are others in society without a political agenda who believe that the advancement of technology has nothing to do with promoting inequalities in certain groups and see this as a ridiculous presumption ethical issues pedestrian detection research from georgia tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darkerskinned individuals this accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions rationale for liability standards for liability have yet to be adopted to address crashes and other incidents liability could rest with the vehicle occupant its owner the vehicle manufacturer or even the adas technology supplier possibly depending on the circumstances of the crash additionally the infusion of artificiai intelligence technology in autonomous vehicles adds layers of complexity to ownership and ethical dynamics given that ai systems are inherently selflearning a question arises of whether accountability should rest with the vehicle owner the manufacturer or the ai developer trolley problem the trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics adapted for acs it considers an ac carrying one passenger confronts a pedestrian who steps in its way the adas notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall killing the passenger possible frameworks include deontology formal rules and utilitarianism harm reduction one public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them while pedestrians took the opposite view utilitarian regulations were unpopular additionally cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios privacy some acs require an internet connection to function opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations routes camera recordings media preferences andor behavioral patterns although this is true of an internetconnected device road infrastructure acs make use of road infrastructure eg traffic signs turn lanes and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals in march 2023 the japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for acs in april 2023 jr east announced their challenge to raise their selfdriving level of kesennuma line bus rapid transit brt in rural area from the current level 2 to level 4 at 60 kmh testing approaches acs can be tested via digital simulations in a controlled test environment andor on public roads road testing typically requires some form of permit or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles for example new york requires a test driver to be in the vehicle prepared to override the adas as necessary 2010s and disengagements in california selfdriving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode this is one measure of system robustness ideally the system should never disengage in 2017 waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352545 mi 567366 km of testing an average distance of 5596 mi 9006 km between disengagements the highest best among companies reporting such figures waymo also logged more autonomous miles than other companies their 2017 rate of 018 disengagements per 1000 mi 1600 km was an improvement over the 02 disengagements per 1000 mi 1600 km in 2016 and 08 in 2015 in march 2017 uber reported an average of 067 mi 108 km per disengagement in the final three months of 2017 cruise owned by gm averaged 5224 mi 8407 km per disengagement over 62689 mi 100888 km 2020s disengagement definitions reporting companies use varying definitions of what qualifies as a disengagement and such definitions can change over time executives of selfdriving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric because it does not consider varying road conditions standards in april 2021 wp29 grva proposed a test method for automated driving natm in october 2021 europes pilot test l3pilot demonstrated adas for cars in hamburg germany in conjunction with its world congress 2021 sae level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads in november 2022 an international standard iso 34502 on scenario based safety evaluation framework was published collision avoidance in april 2022 collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by nissan waymo published a document about collision avoidance testing in december 2022 simulation and validation in september 2022 biprogy released driving intelligence validation platform divp as part of japanese national project sipadus which is interoperable with open simulation interface osi of asam toyota in november 2022 toyota demonstrated one of its gr yaris test cars which had been trained using professional rally drivers toyota used its collaboration with microsoft in fia world rally championship since the 2017 season pedestrian reactions in 2023 david r large senior research fellow with the human factors research group at the university of nottingham disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test peoples reactions to driverless cars he said we wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions the study found that in the absence of someone in the driving seat pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road incidents tesla as of 2023 teslas adas autopilotfull self driving beta was classified as level 2 adas on 20 january 2016 the first of five known fatal crashes of a tesla with autopilot occurred in chinas hubei province initially tesla stated that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to determine whether the car had been on autopilot at the time however the car failed to take evasive action another fatal autopilot crash occurred in may in florida in a tesla model s that crashed into a tractortrailer in a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and tesla tesla documented that the car had been on autopilot according to tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractortrailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied tesla claimed that this was teslas first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles 210 million kilometers with autopilot engaged tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every 94 million miles 151 million kilometers across all vehicle types in the us however this number also includes motorcyclepedestrian fatalities the ultimate national transportation safety board ntsb report concluded tesla was not at fault the investigation revealed that for tesla cars the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after autopilot was installed google waymo in june 2015 google confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date eight involved rearend collisions at a stop sign or traffic light in two of which the vehicle was sideswiped by another driver one in which another driver rolled a stop sign and one where a driver was controlling the car manually in july 2015 three employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rearended by a car whose driver failed to brake this was the first collision that resulted in injuries according to google waymos accident reports as of early 2016 their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions of which other drivers were at fault 13 times although in 2016 the cars software caused a crash on 14 february 2016 a google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path during the maneuver it struck a bus google stated in this case we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadnt moved there wouldnt have been a collision google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience no injuries were reported ubers advanced technologies group atg in march 2018 elaine herzberg died after she was hit by an ac tested by ubers advanced technologies group atg in arizona a safety driver was in the car herzberg was crossing the road about 400 feet from an intersection some experts said a human driver could have avoided the crash arizona governor doug ducey suspended the companys ability to test its acs citing an unquestionable failure of uber to protect public safety uber also stopped testing in california until receiving a new permit in 2020 ntsbs final report determined that the immediate cause of the accident was that safety driver rafaela vasquez failed to monitor the road because she was distracted by her phone but that ubers inadequate safety culture contributed the report noted that the victim had a very high level of methamphetamine in her body the board called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads in september 2020 vasquez pled guilty to endangerment and was sentenced to three years probation nio navigate on pilot on 12 august 2021 a 31yearold chinese man was killed after his nio es8 collided with a construction vehicle nios selfdriving feature was in beta and could not deal with static obstacles the vehicles manual clearly stated that the driver must take over near construction sites lawyers of the deceaseds family questioned nios private access to the vehicle which they argued did not guarantee the integrity of the data ponyai in november 2021 the california department of motor vehicles dmv notified ponyai that it was suspending its testing permit following a reported collision in fremont on 28 october in may 2022 dmv revoked ponyais permit for failing to monitor the driving records of its safety drivers cruise in april 2022 cruises testing vehicle was reported to have blocked a fire engine on emergency call and sparked questions about its ability to handle unexpected circumstances ford in february 2024 a driver using the ford bluecruise handsfree driving feature struck and killed the driver of a stationary car with no lights on in the middle lane of a freeway in texas in march 2024 a drunk driver who was speeding holding her cell phone and using bluecruise on a pennsylvania freeway struck and killed two people who had been driving two cars the first car had become disabled and was on the left shoulder with part of the car in the left driving lane the second driver had parked his car behind the first car presumably to help the first driver the ntsb is investigating both incidents total incidents the nhtsa began mandating incident reports from autonomous vehicle companies in june 2021 some reports cite incidents from as early as august 2019 with current data available through june 17 2024 there have been a total of 3979 autonomous vehicle incidents both ads and adas reported during this timeframe 2146 of those incidents 539 involved tesla vehicles public opinion surveys 2010s in a 2011 online survey of 2006 us and uk consumers 49 said they would be comfortable using a driverless car a 2012 survey of 17400 vehicle owners found 37 who initially said they would be interested in purchasing a fully autonomous car however that figure dropped to 20 if told the technology would cost us3000 more in a 2012 survey of about 1000 german drivers 22 had a positive attitude 10 were undecided 44 were skeptical and 24 were hostile a 2013 survey of 1500 consumers across 10 countries found 57 stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver with brazil india and china the most willing to trust automated technology in a 2014 us telephone survey over threequarters of licensed drivers said they would consider buying a selfdriving car rising to 86 if car insurance were cheaper 317 said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available in 2015 a survey of 5000 people from 109 countries reported that average respondents found manual driving the most enjoyable 22 did not want to pay more money for autonomy respondents were found to be most concerned about hackingmisuse and were also concerned about legal issues and safety finally respondents from more developed countries were less comfortable with their vehicle sharing data the survey reported consumer interest in purchasing an ac stating that 37 of surveyed current owners were either definitely or probably interested in 2016 a survey of 1603 people in germany that controlled for age gender and education reported that men felt less anxiety and more enthusiasm whereas women showed the opposite the difference was pronounced between young men and women and decreased with age in a 2016 us survey of 1584 people 66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver people were worried about safety and hacking risk nevertheless only 13 of the interviewees saw no advantages in this new kind of cars in a 2017 survey of 4135 us adults found that many americans anticipated significant impacts from various automation technologies including the widespread adoption of automated vehicles in 2019 results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 us adults respectively were published the questionnaire was termed the autonomous vehicle acceptance model avam including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of various automation levels users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use autonomous vehicles additionally partial autonomy regardless of level was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement usage of hands feet and eyes than full autonomy in the 2020s in 2022 a survey reported that only a quarter 27 of the worlds population would feel safe in selfdriving cars in 2024 a study by saravanos et al at new york university reported that 87 of their respondents from a sample of 358 believed that conditionally automated cars at level 3 would be easy to use opinion surveys may have little salience given that few respondents had any personal experience with acs regulation the regulation of autonomous cars concerns liability approvals and international conventions in the 2010s researchers openly worried that delayed regulations could delay deployment in 2020 unece wp29 grva was issued to address regulation of level 3 automated driving commercialization vehicles operating below level 5 still
