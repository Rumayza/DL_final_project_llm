agricultural technology or agrotechnology abbreviated agtech agritech agritech or agrotech is the use of technology in agriculture horticulture and aquaculture with the aim of improving yield efficiency and profitability agricultural technology can be products services or applications derived from agriculture that improve various input and output processes advances in agricultural science agronomy and agricultural engineering have led to applied developments in agricultural technology history the history of agriculture has been shaped by technological advances agricultural technology dates back thousands of years historians have described a number of agricultural revolutions which identify major shifts in agricultural practice and productivity these revolutions have been closely connected to technological improvements neolothic to bronze age around 10000 years ago the neolithic revolution catalyzed an epochal transformation humanity transitioned from nomadic huntergatherer societies to stable agricultural communities this transition bore witness to the domestication of vital plants and animals including wheat barley and livestock fundamentally altering the agricultural landscape the surplus food production that ensued fueled population growth and laid the cornerstone for nascent civilizations irrigation technology was developed independently by a number of different cultures with the earliest known examples dated to the 6th millennium bce in khuzistan in the southwest of presentday iran the ancient egyptian use of the nile rivers flooding marked another significant advancement classical period the roman era ushered in notable contributions to agricultural technology the romans introduced innovative implements such as the roman plough a notable refinement in soil cultivation in tandem they compiled comprehensive agricultural manuals like de re rustica serving as invaluable records of contemporary farming techniques middle ages the middle ages bequeathed significant agricultural progress concepts like crop rotation and the threefield system enhanced soil fertility and crop yields while the introduction of the heavy plow driven by draft animals facilitated the cultivation of previously uncultivated lands industrial revolution a major turning point for agricultural technology is the industrial revolution which introduced agricultural machinery to mechanise the labour of agriculture greatly increasing farm worker productivity revolutionary inventions like the seed drill mechanical reaper and steampowered tractors reshaped the farming landscape this period also witnessed the establishment of agricultural societies and colleges dedicated to advancing farming methodologies in modern mechanised agriculture powered machinery has replaced many farm jobs formerly carried out by manual labour or by working animals such as oxen horses and mules advances in the 19th century included the development of modern weather forecasting and invention of barbed wire improvement to portable engines and threshing machines led to their widespread adoption guano became a popular fertilizer in the 1800s and was widely extracted for this purpose guano use rapidly declined after 1910 with the development of the haberbosch process for extracting nitrogen from the atmospherecitation needed 20th century the 20th century saw major advances in agricultural technologies including the development of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and new agricultural machinery including massproduced tractors and agricultural aircraft for aerial application of pesticides more recent advances have included agricultural plastics genetically modified crops improved drip irrigation integrated pest management and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics aquaponics and aeroponics 21st century in the first decades of the 21st century information age technologies have been increasingly applied to agriculture agricultural robots agricultural drones and driverless tractors have found regular use on farms while digital agriculture and precision agriculture make use of extensive data collection and computation to improve farm efficiency precision agriculture includes such areas as precision beekeeping precision livestock farming and precision viticulture agtech hubs israel israels agtech scene is considered second only to
