development of ecommerce along with some developments which raised concerns such as increased use of selective distribution systems which allow manufacturers to control routes to market and increased use of contractual restrictions to better control product distribution the european commission felt that some emerging practices might be justified if they could improve the quality of product distribution but others may unduly prevent consumers from benefiting from greater product choice and lower prices in ecommerce and therefore warrant commission action in order to promote compliance

estimated us899 billion in 2016 it accounted for 424 of worldwide retail ecommerce in that year the most of any country 110 research shows that chinese consumer motivations are different enough from western audiences to require unique ecommerce app designs instead of simply porting western apps into the chinese market the expansion of ecommerce in china has resulted in the development of taobao villages clusters of ecommerce businesses operating in rural areas 112 because taobao villages have increased the incomes or rural people and entrepreneurship in rural china taobao villages have become a component of rural revitalization strategies 278 in 2015 the state council promoted the internet plus initiative a fiveyear plan to integrate traditional manufacturing and service industries with big data cloud computing and internet of things technology 44 the state council provided support for internet plus through policy support in area including crossborder ecommerce and rural

contribution to the enterprises total revenue almost a quarter 24 of the countrys total turnover is generated via the online channel arab states the rate of growth of the number of internet users in the arab countries has been rapid 131 in 2015 a significant portion of the ecommerce market in the middle east comprises people in the 3034 year age group egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region followed by saudi arabia and morocco these constitute 34th of the regions share yet internet penetration is low 35 in egypt and 65 in saudi arabia the gulf cooperation council countries have a rapidly growing market and are characterized by a population that becomes wealthier yuldashev as such retailers have launched arabiclanguage websites as a means to target this population secondly there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience yuldashev the growth and development of the two aspects make the gcc countries become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress specifically research shows that the ecommerce market is expected to grow to over 20 billion by 2020 among these gcc countries yuldashev the ecommerce market has also gained much popularity among western countries and in particular europe and the us these countries have been highly characterized by consumerpackaged goods cpg geisler 34 however trends show that there are future signs of a reverse similar to the gcc countries there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on cpg manufacturers geisler 36 in these senses cpg investors are being forced to adapt to ecommerce as it is effective as well as a means for them to thrive the future trends in the gcc countries will be similar to that of the western countries despite the forces that push business to adapt ecommerce as a means to sell goods and products the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions for instance there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing however the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years it will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend the statistics portal for example uae has the greatest smartphone penetration of 738 per cent and has 919 per cent of its population has access to the internet on the other hand smartphone penetration in europe has been reported to be at 647 per cent the statistics portal regardless the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because ecommerce technology is expected to grow to allow for more users the ecommerce business within these two regions will result in competition government bodies at the country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection krings et al these increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries factors that will determine the success of the ecommerce market in these countries for example an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the ecommerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies as such the future trends between gcc countries and the western countries will be independent of these sanctions krings et al these countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions india india has an internet user base of about 460 million as of december 2017 despite being the third largest user base in the world the penetration of the internet is low compared to markets like the united states united kingdom or france but is growing at a much faster rate adding around six million new entrants every month in india cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method accumulating 75 of the eretail activities the india retail market is expected to rise from 25 in 2016 to 5 in 2020 brazil in 2013 brazils ecommerce was growing quickly with retail ecommerce sales expected to grow at a doubledigit pace through 2014 by 2016 emarketer expected retail ecommerce sales in brazil to reach 173 billion logistics logistics in ecommerce mainly concerns fulfillment online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a companys logistic needs the optimization of logistics processes that contains longterm investment in an efficient storage infrastructure system and adoption of inventory management strategies is crucial to prioritize customer satisfaction throughout the entire process from order placement to final delivery impacts impact on markets and retailers ecommerce markets are growing at noticeable rates the online market is expected to grow by 56 in 20152020 in 2017 retail ecommerce sales worldwide amounted to 23 trillion us dollars and eretail revenues are projected to grow to 4891 trillion us dollars in 2021 traditional markets are only expected 2 growth during the same time brick and mortar retailers are struggling because of online retailers ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings ecommerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacturer the pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery there are two ways for marketers to conduct business through ecommerce fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store online marketers can offer lower prices greater product selection and high efficiency rates many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price however online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can it can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions many customers remain loyal to wellknown retailers because of this issue security is a primary problem for ecommerce in developed and developing countries ecommerce security is protecting businesses websites and customers from unauthorized access use alteration or destruction the type of threats include malicious codes unwanted programs ad ware spyware phishing hacking and cyber vandalism ecommerce websites use different tools to avert security threats these tools include firewalls encryption software digital certificates and passwords impact on supply chain management for a long time companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits however the emergence of ecommerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies ecommerce has the capability to integrate all intercompany and intracompany functions meaning that the three flows physical flow financial flow and information flow of the supply chain could be also affected by ecommerce the affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies for the information flows ecommerce optimized the capacity of information processing than companies used to have and for the financial flows ecommerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions in addition ecommerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains firstly the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions secondly as a result of ecommerce emergence new capabilities such implementing erp systems like sap erp xero or megaventory have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited thirdly technology companies would keep investing on new ecommerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return fourthly ecommerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with such as political barriers or crosscountry changes finally ecommerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain impact on employment ecommerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services software app and digital products it also causes job losses the areas with the greatest predicted jobloss are retail postal and travel agencies the development of ecommerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information customer demands and production processes in contrast people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare on the other hand because ecommerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time the warehouse becomes an important element warehouse needs more staff to manage supervise and organize thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees impact on customers ecommerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse websites online especially for buying products which are not sold in nearby shops it could help customers buy a wider range of products and save customers time consumers also gain power through online shopping they are able to research products and compare prices among retailers thanks to the practice of usergenerated ratings and reviews from companies like bazaarvoice trustpilot and yelp customers can also see what other people think of a product and decide before buying if they want to spend money on it also online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code thus it is more price effective for customers moreover ecommerce provides products detailed information even the instore staff cannot offer such detailed explanation customers can also review and track the order history online ecommerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries this is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase the success of ecommerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to ecommerce however ecommerce lacks human interaction for customers especially who prefer facetoface connection customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to wellknown retailers in recent years clothing retailers such as tommy hilfiger have started adding virtual fit platforms to their ecommerce sites to reduce the risk of customers buying the wrong sized clothes although these vary greatly in their fit for purpose when the customer regret the purchase of a product it involves returning goods and refunding process this process is inconvenient as customers need to pack and post the goods if the products are expensive large or fragile it refers to safety issues impact on the environment in 2018 ecommerce generated 13 million short tons 12 megatonnes of container cardboard in north america an increase from 11 million 100 in 2017 only 35 percent of north american cardboard manufacturing capacity is from recycled content the

reduce and improve their packaging and shipping materials accelerated movement of packages around the world includes accelerated movement of living things with all its attendant risks weeds pests and diseases all sometimes travel in packages of seeds some of these packages are part of brushing manipulation of ecommerce reviews impact on traditional retail ecommerce has been cited as a major force for the failure of major us retailers in a trend frequently referred to as a retail apocalypse the rise of ecommerce outlets like amazon has made it harder for traditional retailers to attract customers to their stores and forced companies to change their sales strategies many companies have turned to sales promotions and increased digital efforts to lure shoppers while shutting down brickandmortar locations the trend has forced some traditional retailers to shutter its brick and mortar operations ecommerce during covid19 in march 2020 global retail website traffic hit 143 billion
