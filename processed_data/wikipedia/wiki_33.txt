educational technology commonly abbreviated as edutech or edtech is the combined use of computer hardware software and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning when referred to with its abbreviation edtech it often refers to the industry of companies that create educational technology in edtech inc selling automating and globalizing higher education in the digital age tanner mirrlees and shahid alvi 2019 argue edtech is no exception to industry ownership and market rules and define the edtech industries as all the privately owned companies currently involved in the financing production and distribution of commercial hardware software cultural goods services and platforms for the educational market with the goal of turning a profit many of these companies are usbased and rapidly expanding into educational markets across north america and increasingly growing all over the world in addition to the practical educational experience educational technology is based on theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication education psychology sociology artificial intelligence and computer science it encompasses several domains including learning theory computerbased training online learning and mlearning where mobile technologies are used definition the association for educational communications and technology aect has defined educational technology as the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources it denotes instructional technology as the theory and practice of design development utilization management and evaluation of processes and resources for learning as such educational technology refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences such as equipment as well as processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research and in a given context may refer to theoretical algorithmic or heuristic processes it does not necessarily imply physical technology educational technology is the process of integrating technology into education in a positive manner that promotes a more diverse learning environment and a way for students to learn how to use technology as well as their common assignments accordingly there are several discrete aspects to describing the intellectual and technical development of educational technology educational technology as the theory and practice of educational approaches to learning educational technology as technological tools and media for instance massive online courses that assist in the communication of knowledge and its development and exchange this is usually what people are referring to when they use the term edtech educational technology for learning management systems lms such as tools for student and curriculum management and education management information systems emis educational technology as backoffice management such as training management systems for logistics and budget management and learning record store lrs for learning data storage and analysis educational technology itself as an educational subject such courses may be called computer studies or information and communications technology ict related terms educational technology is an inclusive term for both the material tools and processes and the theoretical foundations for supporting learning and teaching educational technology is not restricted to advanced technology but is anything that enhances classroom learning in the utilization of blended facetoface or online learning an educational technologist is someone who is trained in the field of educational technology educational technologists try to analyze design develop implement and evaluate processes and tools to enhance learning while the term educational technologist is used primarily in the united states learning technologist is a synonymous term used in the uk as well as canada modern electronic educational technology is an important part of society today educational technology encompasses elearning instructional technology information and communication technology ict

communication cyberlearning and multimodal instruction virtual education personal learning environments networked learning virtual learning environments vle which are also called learning platforms mlearning and digital education each of these numerous terms has had its advocates who point up potential distinctive features however many terms and concepts in educational technology have been defined nebulously for example singh and thurman cite over 45 definitions for online learning moreover moore saw these terminologies as emphasizing particular features such as digitization approaches components or delivery methods rather than being fundamentally dissimilar in concept or principle for example mlearning emphasizes mobility which allows for altered timing location accessibility and context of learning nevertheless its purpose and conceptual principles are those of educational technology in practice as technology has advanced the particular narrowly defined terminological aspect that was initially emphasized by name has blended into the general field of educational technology initially virtual learning as narrowly defined in a semantic sense implied entering an environmental simulation within a virtual world for example in treating posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd in practice a virtual education course refers to any instructional course in which all or at least a significant portion is delivered by the internet virtual is used in that broader way to describe a course that is not taught in a classroom facetoface but virtually with people not having to go to the physical classroom to learn accordingly virtual education refers to a form of distance learning in which course content is delivered using various methods such as course management applications multimedia resources and videoconferencing virtual education and simulated learning opportunities such as games or dissections offer opportunities for students to connect classroom content to authentic situations educational content pervasively embedded in objects is all around the learner who may not even be conscious of the learning process the combination of adaptive learning using an individualized interface and materials which accommodate to an individual who thus receives personally differentiated instruction with ubiquitous access to digital resources and learning opportunities in a range of places and at various times has been termed smart learning smart learning is a component of the smart city concept history helping people and children learn in ways that are easier faster more accurate or less expensive can be traced back to the emergence of very early tools such as paintings on cave walls various types of abacus have been used writing slates and blackboards have been used for at least a millennium since their introduction books and pamphlets have played a prominent role in education from the early twentieth century duplicating machines such as the mimeograph and gestetner stencil devices were used to produce short copy runs typically 1050 copies for classroom or home use the use of media for instructional purposes is generally traced back to the first decade of the 20th century with the introduction of educational films the 1900s and sidney presseys mechanical teaching machines 1920s the first all multiple choice largescale assessment was the army alpha used to assess the intelligence and more specifically the aptitudes of world war i military recruits further largescale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after wwii using films and other mediated materials such as overhead projectors the concept of hypertext is traced to the description of memex by vannevar bush in 1945 slide projectors were widely used during the 1950s in educational institutional settings cuisenaire rods were devised in the 1920s and saw widespread use from the late 1950s in the mid1960s stanford university psychology professors patrick suppes and richard c atkinson experimented with using computers to teach arithmetic and spelling via teletypes to elementary school students in the palo alto unified school district in california stanfords education program for gifted youth is descended from those early experiments online education originated from the university of illinois in 1960 although the internet would not be created for another decade students were able to access class information with linked computer terminals online learning emerged in 1982 when the western behavioral sciences institute in la jolla california opened its school of management and strategic studies the school employed computer conferencing through the new jersey institute of technologys electronic information exchange system eies to deliver a distance education program to business executives starting in 1985 connected education offered the first totally online masters degree in media studies through the new school in new york city also via the eies computer conferencing system subsequent courses were offered in 1986 by the electronic university network for dos and commodore 64 computers in 2002 mit began providing online classes free of charge as of 2009 approximately 55 million students were taking at least one class online currently one out of three college students takes at least one online course while in college at devry university out of all students that are earning a bachelors degree 80 earn twothirds of their requirements online also in 2014 285 million students out of 58 million students that took courses online took all of their courses online from this information it can be concluded that the number of students taking classes online is on a steady increase the recent article shift happens online education as a new paradigm in learning linda harasim covers an overview of the history of online education as well as a framework for understanding the type of need it addresses the concept of distance learning has already been invented for many centuries the value of online education is not found in its ability to establish a method for distance learning but rather in its power to make this type of learning process more efficient by providing a medium in which the instructor and their students can virtually interact with one another in realtime the topic of online education started primarily in the late 1900s when institutions and businesses started to make products to assist students learning these groups desired a need to further develop educational services across the globe primarily to developing countries in 1960 the university of illinois created a system of linked computer terminals known as the intranet to give students access to recorded lectures and course materials that they could watch or use in their free time this type of concept called plato programmed logic for automatic teaching operations was rapidly introduced throughout the globe many institutions adopted this similar technique while the internet was in its developmental phase in 1971 ivan illich published a hugely influential book deschooling society in which he envisioned learning webs as a model for people to network the learning they needed the 1970s and 1980s saw notable contributions in computerbased learning by murray turoff and starr roxanne hiltz at the new jersey institute of technology as well as developments at the university of guelph in canada in the uk the council for educational technology supported the use of educational technology in particular administering the governments national development programme in computer aided learning 19731977 and the microelectronics education programme 19801986 by the mid1980s accessing course content became possible at many college libraries in computerbased training cbt or computerbased learning cbl the learning interaction was between the student and computer drills or microworld simulations digitized communication and networking in education started in the mid1980s educational institutions began to take advantage of the new medium by offering distance learning courses using computer networking for information early elearning systems based on computerbased learningtraining often replicated autocratic teaching styles whereby the role of the elearning system was assumed to be for transferring knowledge as opposed to systems developed later based on computersupported collaborative learning cscl which encouraged the shared development of knowledge videoconferencing was an important forerunner to the educational technologies known today this work was especially popular with museum education even in recent years videoconferencing has risen in popularity to reach over 20000 students across the united states and canada in 20082009 disadvantages of this form of educational technology are readily apparent image and sound quality are often grainy or pixelated videoconferencing requires setting up a type of minitelevision studio within the museum for broadcast space becomes an issue and specialized equipment is required for both the provider and the participant the open university in britain and the university of british columbia where web ct now incorporated into blackboard inc was first developed began a revolution of using the internet to deliver learning making heavy use of webbased training online distance learning and online discussion between students practitioners such as harasim 1995 put heavy emphasis on the use of learning networks with the advent of the world wide web in the 1990s teachers embarked on the method of using emerging technologies to employ multiobject oriented sites which are textbased online virtual reality systems to create course websites along with simple sets of instructions for their students by 1994 the first online high school had been founded in 1997 graziadei described criteria for evaluating products and developing technologybased courses that include being portable replicable scalable affordable and having a high probability of longterm costeffectiveness improved internet functionality enabled new schemes of communication with multimedia or webcams the national center for education statistics estimates the number of k12 students enrolled in online distance learning programs increased by 65 from 2002 to 2005 with greater flexibility ease of communication between teacher and student and quick lecture and assignment feedback according to a 2008 study conducted by the us department of education during the 20062007 academic year about 66 of postsecondary public and private schools participating in student financial aid programs offered some distance learning courses records show 77 of enrollment in forcredit courses with an online component in 2008 the council of europe passed a statement endorsing elearnings potential to drive equality and education improvements across the eu computermediated communication cmc is between learners and instructors mediated by the computer in contrast cbtcbl usually means individualized selfstudy learning while cmc involves educatortutor facilitation and requires the scalarization of flexible learning activities in addition modern ict provides education with tools for sustaining learning communities and associated knowledge management tasks students growing up in this digital age have extensive exposure to a variety of media major hightech companies have funded schools to provide them with the ability to teach their students through technology 2015 was the first year that private nonprofit organizations enrolled more online students than forprofits although public universities still enrolled the highest number of online students in the fall of 2015 more than 6 million students enrolled in at least one online course in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic many schools across the world were forced to close which left more and more gradeschool students participating in online learning and universitylevel students enrolling in online courses to enforce distance learning organizations such as unesco have enlisted educational technology solutions to help schools facilitate distance education the pandemics extended lockdowns and focus on distance learning has attracted recordbreaking amounts of venture capital to the edtech sector in 2020 in the united states alone edtech startups raised 178 billion in venture capital spanning 265 deals compared to 132 billion in 2019 theory various pedagogical perspectives or learning theories may be considered in designing and interacting with educational technology elearning theory examines these approaches these theoretical perspectives are grouped into three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks behaviorism cognitivism and constructivism behaviorism this theoretical framework was developed in the early 20th century based on animal learning experiments by ivan pavlov edward thorndike edward c tolman clark l hull and bf skinner many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning but modern educators generally see behaviorism as one aspect of a holistic synthesis teaching in behaviorism has been linked to training emphasizing animal learning experiments since behaviorism consists of the view of teaching people how to do something with rewards and punishments it is related to training people bf skinner wrote extensively on improvements in teaching based on his functional analysis of verbal behavior and wrote the technology of teaching an attempt to dispel the myths underlying contemporary education as well as promote his system he called programmed instruction ogden lindsley developed a learning system named celeration which was based on behavior analysis but substantially differed from kellers and skinners models cognitivism cognitive science underwent significant change in the 1960s and 1970s to the point that some described the period as a cognitive revolution particularly in reaction to behaviorism while retaining the empirical framework of behaviorism cognitive psychology theories look beyond behavior to explain brainbased learning by considering how human memory works to promote learning it refers to learning as all processes by which the sensory input is transformed reduced elaborated stored recovered and used by the human mind the atkinsonshiffrin memory model and baddeleys working memory model were established as theoretical frameworks computer science and information technology have had a major influence on cognitive science theory the cognitive concepts of working memory formerly known as shortterm memory and longterm memory have been facilitated by research and technology from the field of computer science another major influence on the field of cognitive science is noam chomsky today researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load information processing and media psychology these theoretical perspectives influence instructional design there are two separate schools of cognitivism and these are the cognitivist and social cognitivist the former focuses on the understanding of the thinking or cognitive processes of an individual while the latter includes social processes as influences in learning besides cognition these two schools however share the view that learning is more than a behavioral change but is rather a mental process used by the learner constructivism educational psychologists distinguish between several types of constructivism individual or psychological constructivism such as piagets theory of cognitive development and social constructivism this form of constructivism has a primary focus on how learners construct their own meaning from new information as they interact with reality and with other learners who bring different perspectives constructivist learning environments require students to use their prior knowledge and experiences to formulate new related andor adaptive concepts in learning termos 2012 under this framework the role of the teacher becomes that of a facilitator providing guidance so that learners can construct their own knowledge constructivist educators must make sure that the prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught jonassen 1997 suggests wellstructured learning environments are useful for novice learners and that illstructured environments are only useful for more advanced learners educators utilizing a constructivist perspective may emphasize an active learning environment that may incorporate learnercentered problembased learning projectbased learning and inquirybased learning ideally involving realworld scenarios in which students are actively engaged in critical thinking activities an illustrative discussion and example can be found in the 1980s deployment of constructivist cognitive learning in computer literacy which involved programming as an instrument of learning 224 logo a programming language embodied an attempt to integrate piagetian ideas with computers and technology initially there were broad hopeful claims including perhaps the most controversial claim that it would improve general problemsolving skills across disciplines 238 however logo programming skills did not consistently yield cognitive benefits 238 it was not as concrete as advocates claimed it privileged one form of reasoning over all others and it was difficult to apply the thinking activity to nonlogobased activities by the late 1980s logo and other similar programming languages had lost their novelty and dominance and were gradually deemphasized amid criticisms practice the extent to which elearning assists or replaces other learning and teaching approaches is variable ranging on a continuum from none to fully online distance learning a variety of descriptive terms have been employed somewhat inconsistently to categorize the extent to which technology is used for example hybrid learning or blended learning may refer to classroom aids and laptops or may refer to approaches in which traditional classroom time is reduced but not eliminated and is replaced with some online learning distributed learning may describe either the elearning component of a hybrid approach or fully online distance learning environments synchronous and asynchronous elearning may either be synchronous or asynchronous synchronous learning occurs in realtime with all participants interacting at the same time in contrast asynchronous learning is selfpaced and allows participants to engage in the exchange of ideas or information without the dependency on other participants involvement at the same time synchronous learning refers to exchanging ideas and information with one or more participants during the same period examples are facetoface discussion online realtime live teacher instruction and feedback skype conversations and chat rooms or virtual classrooms where everyone is online and working collaboratively at the same time since students are working collaboratively synchronized learning helps students become more openminded because they have to actively listen and learn from their peers synchronized learning fosters online awareness and improves many students writing skills asynchronous learning may use technologies such as learning management systems email blogs wikis and discussion boards as well as websupported textbooks hypertext documents audio video courses and social networking using web 20 at the professional educational level training may include virtual operating rooms asynchronous learning is beneficial for students who have health problems or who have childcare responsibilities they have the opportunity to complete their work in a lowstress environment and within a more flexible time frame in asynchronous online courses students are allowed the freedom to complete work at their own pace being nontraditional students they can manage their daily life and school and still have the social aspect asynchronous collaborations allow the student to reach out for help when needed and provide helpful guidance depending on how long it takes them to complete the assignment many tools used for these courses are but are not limited to videos class discussions and group projects through online courses students can earn their diplomas faster or repeat failed courses without being in a class with younger students students have access to various enrichment courses in online learning still participate in college courses internships sports or work and still graduate with their classes linear learning computerbased training cbt refers to selfpaced learning activities delivered on a computer or handheld devices such as a tablet or smartphone cbt initially delivered content via cdrom and typically presented content linearly much like reading an online book or manual for this reason cbt is often used to teach static processes such as using software or completing mathematical equations computerbased training is conceptually similar to webbased training wbt which is delivered via internet using a web browser assessing learning in a cbt is often by assessments that can be easily scored by a computer such as multiplechoice questions draganddrop radio button simulation or other interactive means assessments are easily scored and recorded via online software providing immediate enduser feedback and completion status users are often able to print completion records in the form of certificates cbts provide learning stimulus beyond traditional learning methodology from textbook manual or classroombased instruction cbts can be a good alternative to printed learning materials since rich media including videos or animations can be embedded to enhance learning however cbts pose some learning challenges typically the creation of effective cbts requires enormous resources the software for developing cbts is often more complex than a subject matter expert or teacher is able to use the lack of human interaction can limit both the type of content that can be presented and the type of assessment that can be performed and may need supplementation with online discussion or other interactive elements collaborative learning computersupported collaborative learning cscl uses instructional methods designed to encourage or require students to work together on learning tasks allowing social learning cscl is similar in concept to the terminology elearning 20 and networked collaborative learning ncl with web 20 advances sharing information between multiple people in a network has become much easier and use has increased 1 one of the main reasons for its usage states that it is a breeding ground for creative and engaging educational endeavors 2 learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions this collaborative learning differs from instruction in which the instructor is the principal source of knowledge and skills the neologism elearning 10 refers to direct instruction used in early computerbased learning and training systems cbl in contrast to that linear delivery of content often directly from the instructors material cscl uses social software such as blogs social media wikis podcasts cloudbased document portals discussion groups and virtual worlds this phenomenon has been referred to as long tail learning advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others social networks have been used to foster online learning communities around subjects as diverse as test preparation and language education mobileassisted language learning mall is the use of handheld computers or cell phones to assist in language learning collaborative apps allow students and teachers to interact while studying apps are designed after games which provide a fun way to revise when the experience is enjoyable the students become more engaged games also usually come with a sense of progression which can help keep students motivated and consistent while trying to improve classroom 20 refers to online multiuser virtual environments muves that connect schools across geographical frontiers known as etwinning computersupported collaborative learning cscl allows learners in one school to communicate with learners in another that they would not get to know otherwise enhancing educational outcomes and cultural integration further many researchers distinguish between collaborative and cooperative approaches to group learning for example roschelle and teasley 1995 argue that cooperation is accomplished by the division of labor among participants as an activity where each person is responsible for a portion of the problem solving in contrast with collaboration that involves the mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve the problem together social technology and social media specifically provides avenues for student learning that would not be available otherwise for example it provides ordinary students a chance to exist in the same room as and share a dialogue with researchers politicians and activists this is because it vaporizes the geographical barriers that would otherwise separate people simplified social media gives students a reach that provides them with opportunities and conversations that allow them to grow as communicators social technologies like twitter can provide students with an archive of free data that goes back multiple decades many classrooms and educators are already taking advantage of this free resourcefor example researchers and educators at the university of central florida in 2011 used tweets posted relating to emergencies like hurricane irene as data points in order to teach their students how to code data social media technologies also allow instructors the ability to show students how professional networks facilitate work on a technical level flipped classroom this is an instructional strategy where the majority of the initial learning occurs first at home using technology then students will engage with higherorder learning tasks in the classroom with the teacher often online tools are used for the individual athome learning such as educational videos learning management systems interactive tools and other webbased resources some advantages of flipped learning include improved learning performance enhanced student satisfaction and engagement flexibility in learning and increased interaction opportunities between students and instructors on the other hand the disadvantages of flipped learning involve challenges related to student motivation internet accessibility quality of videos and increased workload for teachers the large majority of studies focusing on the success of flipped learning are in the higher education context technologies educational media and tools can be used for task structuring support help with how to do a task procedures and processes access to knowledge bases help user find information needed alternate forms of knowledge representation multiple representations of knowledge eg video audio text image data numerous types of physical technology are currently used digital cameras video cameras interactive whiteboard tools document cameras electronic media and lcd projectors combinations of these techniques include blogs collaborative software eportfolios and virtual classrooms the current design of this type of application includes the evaluation through tools of cognitive analysis that allow one to identify which elements optimize the use of these platforms audio and video video technology has included vhs tapes and dvds as well as ondemand and synchronous methods with digital video via server or webbased options such as streamed video and webcams videotelephony can connect with speakers and other experts interactive digital video games are being used at k12 and higher education institutions radio offers a synchronous educational vehicle while streaming audio over the internet with webcasts and podcasts can be asynchronous classroom microphones often wireless can enable learners and educators to interact more clearly screencasting allows users to share their screens directly from their browser and make the video available online so that other viewers can stream the video directly the presenter thus has the ability to show their ideas and flow of thoughts rather than simply explain them as simple text content in combination with audio and video the educator can mimic the oneonone experience of the classroom learners have the ability to pause and rewind to review at their own pace something a classroom cannot always offer webcams and webcasting have enabled the creation of virtual classrooms and virtual learning environments webcams are also being used to counter plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty that might occur in an elearning environment computers tablets and mobile devices collaborative learning is a groupbased learning approach in which learners are mutually engaged in a coordinated fashion to achieve a learning goal or complete a learning task with recent developments in smartphone technology the processing powers and storage capabilities of modern mobiles allow for advanced development and the use of apps many app developers and education experts have been exploring smartphone and tablet apps as a medium for collaborative learning computers and tablets enable learners and educators to access websites as well as applications many mobile devices support mlearning mobile devices such as clickers and smartphones can be used for interactive audience response feedback mobile learning can provide performance support for checking the time setting reminders retrieving worksheets and instruction manuals such devices as ipads are used for helping disabled visually impaired or with multiple disabilities children in communication development as well as in improving physiological activity according to the stimulation practice report studies in preschool early learning primary and secondary education have explored how digital devices are used to enable effective learning outcomes and create systems that can support teachers digital technology can improve teaching and learning by motivating students with engaging interactive and fun learning environments these online interactions enable further opportunities to develop digital literacy 21st century skills and digital citizenship singleboard computers and internet of things embedded singleboard computers and microcontrollers such as raspberry pi arduino and beaglebone are easy to program some can run linux and connect to devices such as sensors displays leds and robotics these are cost effective computing devices ideal for learning programming which work with cloud computing and the internet of things the internet of things refers to a type of network to connect anything with the internetbased on stipulated protocols through information sensing equipment to conduct information exchange and communications to achieve smart recognitions positioning tracking monitoring and administration these devices are part of a maker culture that embraces tinkering with electronics and programming to achieve software and hardware solutions the maker culture means there is a huge amount of training and support available collaborative and social learning group webpages blogs wikis and twitter allow learners and educators to post thoughts ideas and comments on a website in an interactive learning environment social networking sites are virtual communities for people interested in a particular subject to communicate by voice chat instant message video conference or blogs the national school boards association found that 96 of students with online access have used social networking technologies and more than 50 talk online about schoolwork social networking encourages collaboration and engagement and can be a motivational tool for selfefficacy amongst students whiteboards there are three types of whiteboards the initial whiteboards analogous to blackboards date from the late 1950s the term whiteboard is also used metaphorically to refer to virtual whiteboards in which computer software applications simulate whiteboards by allowing writing or drawing this is a common feature of groupware for virtual meetings collaboration and instant messaging interactive whiteboards allow learners and instructors to write on the touch screen the screen markup can be on either a blank whiteboard or any computer screen content depending on permission settings this visual learning can be interactive and participatory including writing and manipulating images on the interactive whiteboard virtual classroom a virtual learning environment vle also known as a learning platform simulates a virtual classroom or meeting by simultaneously mixing several communication technologiesweb conferencing software enables students and instructors to communicate with each other via webcam microphone and realtime chatting in a group setting participants can raise their hands answer polls or take tests students can whiteboard and screencast when given rights by the instructor who sets permission levels for text notes microphone rights and mouse control a virtual classroom provides an opportunity for students to receive direct instruction from a qualified teacher in an interactive environment learners can have direct and immediate access to their instructor for instant feedback and direction the virtual classroom provides a structured schedule of classes which can be helpful for students who may find the freedom of asynchronous learning to be overwhelming besides the virtual classroom provides a social learning environment that replicates the traditional brick and mortar classroom most virtual classroom applications provide a recording feature each class is recorded and stored on a server which allows for instant playback of any class over the course of the school year this can be extremely useful for students to retrieve missed material or review concepts for an upcoming exam parents and auditors have the conceptual ability to monitor any classroom to ensure that they are satisfied with the education the learner is receiving in higher education especially a virtual learning environment vle is sometimes combined with a management information system mis to create a managed learning environment in which all aspects of a course are handled through a consistent user interface throughout the institution physical universities and newer onlineonly colleges offer to select academic degrees and certificate programs via the internet some programs require students to attend some campus classes or orientations but many are delivered completely online several universities offer online student support services such as online advising and registration ecounseling online textbook purchases student governments and student newspapers due to the covid19 pandemic many schools have been forced to move online as of april 2020 an estimated 90 of highincome countries are offering online learning with only 25 of lowincome countries offering the same augmented reality augmented reality ar provides students and teachers with the opportunity to create layers of digital information including both virtual worlds and realworld elements to interact in realtime ar technology plays an important role in the future of the classroom where human i coorchestration takes place seamlessly students would switch between individual and collaborative learning dynamically based on their own learning pace while teachers with the help of ar monitor the classroom and provide necessary interventions in cases where computer systems are not yet designed to handle certain aspects in this vision the technologys role is to enhance rather than replace human teachers capabilities learning management system a learning management system lms is software used for delivering tracking and managing training and education it tracks data about attendance time on task and student progress educators can post announcements grade assignments check on course activities and participate in class discussions students can submit their work read and respond to discussion questions and take quizzes an lms may allow teachers administrators and students and permitted additional parties such as parents if appropriate to track various metrics lmss range from systems for managing trainingeducational records to software for distributing courses over the internet and offering features for online collaboration the creation and maintenance of comprehensive learning content require substantial initial and ongoing investments in human labor effective translation into other languages and cultural contexts requires even more investment by knowledgeable personnel internetbased learning management systems include canvas blackboard inc and moodle these types of lms allow educators to run a learning system partially or fully online asynchronously or synchronously learning management systems also offers a nonlinear presentation of content and curricular goals giving students the choice of pace and order of information learned blackboard can be used for k12 education higher education business and government collaboration moodle is a freetodownload open source course management system that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for distance learning courses learning content management system a learning content management system lcms is software for author content courses reusable content objects an lcms may be solely dedicated to producing and publishing content that is hosted on an lms or it can host the content itself the aviation industry computerbased training committee aicc specification provides support for content that is hosted separately from the lms a recent trend in lcmss is to address this issue through crowdsourcing cfslidewiki computeraided assessment computeraided assessment eassessment ranges from automated multiplechoice tests to more sophisticated systems with some systems feedback can be geared towards a students specific mistakes or the computer can navigate the student through a series of questions adapting to what the student appears to have learned or not learned formative assessment sifts out the incorrect answers and these questions are then explained by the teacher the learner then practices with slight variations of the siftedout questions the process is completed by summative assessment using a new set of questions that only cover the topics previously taught training management system a training management system or training resource management system is software designed to optimize instructorled training management similar to an enterprise resource planning erp it is a back office tool that aims at streamlining every aspect of the training process planning training plan and budget forecasting logistics scheduling and resource management financials cost tracking profitability reporting and sales forprofit training providers a training management system can be used to schedule instructors venues and equipment through graphical agendas optimize resource utilization create a training plan and track remaining budgets generate reports and share data between different teams while training management systems focus on managing instructorled training they can complete an lms in this situation an lms will manage elearning delivery and assessment while a training management system will manage ilt and backoffice budget planning logistics and reporting standards and ecosystem learning objects content content and design architecture issues include pedagogy and learning object reuse one approach looks at five aspects fact unique data eg symbols for excel formula or the parts that make up a learning objective concept a category that includes multiple examples eg excel formulas or the various typestheories of instructional design process a flow of events or activities eg how a spreadsheet works or the five phases in addie procedure stepbystep task eg entering a formula into a spreadsheet or the steps that should be followed within a phase in addie strategic principle a task performed by adapting guidelines eg doing a financial projection in a spreadsheet or using a framework for designing learning environments pedagogical elements pedagogical elements are defined as structures or units of educational material they are the educational content that is to be delivered these units are independent of format meaning that although the unit may be delivered in various ways the pedagogical structures themselves are not the textbook web page video conference podcast lesson assignment multiplechoice question quiz discussion group or a case study all of which are possible methods of delivery learning objects standards much effort has been put into the technical reuse of electronically based teaching materials and in particular creating or reusing learning objects these are selfcontained units that are properly tagged with keywords or other metadata and often stored in an xml file format creating a course requires putting together a sequence of learning objects there are both proprietary and open noncommercial and commercial peerreviewed repositories of learning objects such as the merlot repository sharable content object reference model scorm is a collection of standards and specifications that applies to certain webbased elearning other specifications such as schools interoperability framework allow for the transporting of learning objects or for categorizing metadata lom artificial intelligence the academic study and development of artificial intelligence can be dated to at least 1956 when cognitive scientists began to investigate thought and learning processes in humans and machines the earliest uses of ai in education can be traced to the development of intelligent tutoring systems its and their application in enhancing educational experiences they are designed to provide immediate and personalized feedback to students the incentive to develop its comes from educational studies showing that individual tutoring is much more effective than group teaching in addition to the need for promoting learning on a larger scale over the years a combination of cognitive science and datadriven techniques have greatly enhanced the capabilities of its allowing it to model a wide range of students characteristics such as knowledge affect offtask behavior and wheel spinning there is ample evidence that its are highly effective in helping students learn its can be used to keep students in the zone of proximal development zpd the space wherein students may learn with guidance such systems can guide students through tasks slightly above their ability level generative artificial intelligence genai emerged with the introduction of chatgpt in november 2022 this caused alarm among k12 and higher education institutions with a few large school districts quickly banning genai due to concerns about potential academic misconduct however as the debate developed these bans were largely reversed within a few months to combat academic misconduct detection tools have been developed there have been various use cases in education including providing personalized feedback brainstorming classroom activities support for students with special needs streamlining administrative tasks and simplifying assessment processes however there are concerns that genais can output incorrect information also known as hallucination the results from genai can also be biased leading to calls for transparency regarding the data used to train genai models and their use providing professional development for teachers and developing policies and regulations can help mitigate the ethical concerns of genai and while ai systems can provide individualized instruction and adaptive feedback to students they have the potential to impact students wellbeing and sense of classroom community settings and sectors preschool various forms of electronic media can be a feature of preschool life although parents report a positive experience the impact of such use has not been systematically assessed the age when a given child might start using a particular technology such as a cellphone or computer might depend on matching a technological resource to the recipients developmental capabilities such as the ageanticipated stages labeled by swiss psychologist jean piaget parameters such as ageappropriateness coherence with soughtafter values and concurrent entertainment and educational aspects have been suggested for choosing media at the preschool level technology can be introduced in several ways at the most basic is the use of computers tablets and audio and video resources in classrooms additionally there are many resources available for parents and educators to introduce technology to young children or to use technology to augment lessons and enhance learning some options that are ageappropriate are video or audiorecording of their creations introducing them to the use of the internet through browsing ageappropriate websites providing assistive technology to allow disabled children to participate with the rest of their peers educational apps electronic books and educational videos there are many free and paid educational website and apps that are directly targeting the educational needs of preschool children these include starfall abc mouse pbs kids video teach me and montessori crosswords educational technology in the form of electronic books 109 offer preschool children the option to store and retrieve several books on one device thus bringing together the traditional action of reading along with the use of educational technology educational technology is also thought to improve handeye coordination language skills visual attention and motivation to complete educational tasks and allows children to experience things they otherwise would not there are several keys to making the most educational use of introducing technology at the preschool level technology must be used appropriately should allow access to learning opportunities should include the interaction of parents and other adults with the preschool children and should be developmentally appropriate allowing access to learning opportunities especially for allowing disabled children to have access to learning opportunities giving bilingual children the opportunity to communicate and learn in more than one language bringing in more information about stem subjects and bringing in images of diversity that may be lacking in the childs immediate environment coding is also becoming part of the early learning curriculum and preschoolaged children can benefit from experiences that teach coding skills even in a screenfree way there are activities and games that teach handson coding skills that prepare students for the coding concepts they will encounter and use in the future minecraft and roblox are two popular coding and programming apps being adopted by institutions that offer free or lowcost access primary and secondary elearning is utilized by public k12 schools in the united states as well as private schools some elearning environments take place in a traditional classroom others allow students to attend classes from home or other locations there are several states that are utilizing virtual school platforms for elearning across the country which continue to increase virtual school enables students to log into synchronous learning or asynchronous learning courses anywhere there is an internet connection elearning is increasingly being utilized by students who may not want to go to traditional brickandmortar schools due to severe allergies or other medical issues fear of school violence and school bullying and students whose parents would like to homeschool but do not feel qualified online schools create a haven for students to receive a quality education while almost completely avoiding these common problems online charter schools also often are not limited by location income level or class size in the way brick and mortar charter schools are elearning also has been rising as a supplement to the traditional classroom students with special talents or interests outside of the available curricula use elearning to advance their skills or exceed grade restrictions some online institutions connect students with instructors via web conference technology to form a digital classroom national private schools are also available online these provide the benefits of elearning to students in states where charter online schools are not available they also may allow students greater flexibility and exemption from state testing some of these schools are available at the high school level and offer college prep courses to students virtual education in k12 schooling often refers to virtual schools and in higher education to virtual universities virtual schools are cybercharter schools with innovative administrative models and course delivery technology education technology also seems to be an interesting method of engaging gifted youths that are understimulated in their current educational program this can be achieved with afterschool programs or even technologicallyintegrated curricula for example virtual reality integrated courses vric can be developed for any course in order to give them such stimulation 3d printing integrated courses 3dpic can also give youths the stimulation they need in their educational journey universit de montrals projet seur in collaboration with collge montroyal and la variable are heavily developing this field higher education online college course enrollment has seen a 29 increase in enrollment with nearly onethird of all college students or an estimated 67 million students are currently enrolled in online classes in 2009 44 of postsecondary students in the usa were taking some or all of their courses online which was projected to rise to 81 by 2014 although a large proportion of forprofit higher education institutions now offer online classes only about half of private nonprofit schools do so private institutions may become more involved with online presentations as the costs decrease properly trained staff must also be hired to work with students online these staff members need to understand the content area and also be highly trained in the use of the computer and internet online education is rapidly increasing and online doctoral programs have even developed at leading research universities although massive open online courses moocs may have limitations that preclude them from fully replacing college education such programs have significantly expanded mit stanford and princeton university offer classes to a global audience but not for college credit universitylevel programs like edx founded by massachusetts institute of technology and harvard university offer a wide range of disciplines at no charge while others permit students to audit a course at no charge but require a small fee for accreditation moocs have not had a significant impact on higher education and declined after the initial expansion but are expected to remain in some form lately moocs are used by smaller universities to profile themselves with highly specialized courses for specialinterest audiences as for example in a course on technological privacy compliance moocs have been observed to lose the majority of their initial course participants in a study performed by cornell and stanford universities studentdropout rates from moocs have been attributed to student anonymity the solitude of the learning experience and to the lack of interaction with peers and with teachers effective student engagement measures that reduce dropouts are forum interactions and virtual teacher or teaching assistant presence measures which induce staff cost that grows with the number of participating students corporate and professional elearning is being used by companies to deliver mandatory compliance training and updates for regulatory compliance soft skills and it skills training continuing professional development cpd and other valuable workplace skills companies with spread out distribution chains use elearning for delivering information about the latest product developments most corporate elearning is asynchronous and delivered and managed via learning management systems the big challenge in corporate elearning is to engage the staff especially on compliance topics for which periodic staff training is mandated by the law or regulations government and public elearning and educational technology is used by governmental bodies to train staff and civil service however government agencies also have an interest in promoting digital technology use and improving skills amongst the people they serve educational technology has been used in such training provision for example in the uk the skills bootcamp scheme aims to improve the skillset of general population through the use of educational technological training government agencies act to promote the use of educational technology in schools and by private enterprise benefits effective technology use deploys multiple evidencebased strategies concurrently eg adaptive content frequent testing immediate feedback etc as do effective teachers using computers or other forms of technology can give students practice on core content and skills while the teacher can work with others conduct assessments or perform other tasks through the use of educational technology education is able to be individualized for each student allowing for better differentiation and allowing students to work for mastery at their own pace modern educational technology can improve access to education including full degree programs it enables better integration for nonfulltime students particularly in continuing education and improved interactions between students and instructors learning material can be used for longdistance learning and are accessible to a wider audience course materials are easy to access in 2010 703 of american family households had access to the internet in 2013 according to canadian radiotelevision and telecommunications commission canada 79 of homes have access to the internet students can access and engage with numerous online resources at home using online resources can help students spend more time on specific aspects of what they may be learning in school but at home schools like the massachusetts institute of technology mit have made certain course materials free online although some aspects of a classroom setting are missed by using these resources they are helpful tools to add additional support to the educational system the necessity to pay for transport to the educational facility is removed students appreciate the convenience of elearning but report greater engagement in facetoface learning environments colleges and universities are working towards combating this issue by utilizing web 20 technologies as well as incorporating more mentorships between students and faculty members according to james kulik who studies the effectiveness of computers used for instruction students usually learn more in less time when receiving computerbased instruction and they like classes more and develop more positive attitudes toward computers in computerbased classes students can independently solve problems there are no intrinsic agebased restrictions on difficulty level ie students can go at their own pace students editing their written work on word processors improve the quality of their writing according to some studies the students are better at critiquing and editing written work that is exchanged over a computer network with students they know studies completed in computer intensive settings found increases in studentcentric cooperative and higherorder learning writing skills problemsolving and using technology in addition attitudes toward technology as a learning tool by parents students and teachers are also improved employers acceptance of online education has risen over time more than 50 of human resource managers shrm surveyed for an august 2010 report said that if two candidates with the same level of experience were applying for a job it would not have any kind of effect whether the candidates obtained degree was acquired through an online or a traditional school seventynine percent said they had employed a candidate with an online degree in the past 12 months however 66 said candidates who get degrees online were not seen as positively as job applicants with traditional degrees the use of educational apps generally has a positive effect on learning pre and posttests have revealed that the use of educational apps on mobile devices reduces the achievement gap between struggling and average students some educational apps improve group work by allowing students to receive feedback on answers and promoting collaboration in solving problems the benefits of appassisted learning have been exhibited in all age groups kindergarten students that use ipads show much higher rates of literacy than nonusers medical students at the university of california irvine that utilized ipad academically have been reported to score 23 higher on national exams than in previous classes that did not disadvantages globally factors like change management technology obsolescence and vendordeveloper partnership are major restraints that are hindering the growth of the educational technology market in the us state and federal government increased funding as well as private venture capital has been flowing into the education sector however as of 2013 none were looking at technology return on investment roi to connect expenditures on technology with improved student outcomes new technologies are frequently accompanied by unrealistic hype and promise regarding their transformative power to change education for the better or in allowing better educational opportunities to reach the masses examples include silent film broadcast radio and television none of which have maintained much of a foothold in the daily practices of mainstream formal education technology in and of itself does not necessarily result in fundamental improvements to educational practice the focus needs to be on the learners interaction with technologynot the technology itself it needs to be recognized as ecological rather than additive or subtractive in this ecological change one significant change will create total change according to branford et al technology does not guarantee effective learning and inappropriate use of technology can even hinder it a university of washington study of infant vocabulary shows that it is slipping due to educational baby dvds published in the journal of pediatrics a 2007 university of washington study on the vocabulary of babies surveyed over 1000 parents in washington and minnesota the study found that for every hour that babies 816 months of age watched dvds and videos they knew 68 fewer of 90 common baby words than the babies that did not watch them andrew meltzoff a surveyor in this study states that the result makes sense that if the babys alert time is spent in front of dvds and tv instead of with people speaking the babies are not going to get the same linguistic experience dimitri chistakis another surveyor reported that the evidence is mounting that baby dvds are of no value and may be harmful adaptive instructional materials tailor questions to each students ability and calculate their scores but this encourages students to work individually rather than socially or collaboratively kruse 2013 social relationships are important but hightech environments may compromise the balance of trust care and respect between teacher and student massively open online courses moocs although quite popular in discussions of technology and education in developed countries more so in the us are not a major concern in most developing or lowincome countries one of the stated goals of moocs is to provide less fortunate populations ie in developing countries an opportunity to experience courses with usstyle content and structure however research shows only 3 of the registrants are from lowincome countries and although many courses have thousands of registered students only 510 of them complete the course this can be attributed to lack of staff support course difficulty and low levels of engagement with peers moocs also implies that certain curriculum and teaching methods are superior and this could eventually wash over or possibly washing out local educational institutions cultural norms and educational traditions with the internet and social media using educational apps makes students highly susceptible to distraction and sidetracking even though proper use has been shown to increase student performance being distracted would be detrimental another disadvantage is an increased potential for cheating one method is done by creating multiple accounts to survey questions and gather information which can be assimilated so that the master account is able to fill in the correct answers smartphones can be very easy to hide and use inconspicuously especially if their use is normalized in the classroom these disadvantages can be managed with strict rules and regulations on mobile phone use a disadvantage of elearning is that it can cause depression according to a study made during the 2021 covid19 quarantines overstimulation electronic devices such as cell phones and computers facilitate rapid access to a stream of sources each of which may receive cursory attention michel rich an associate professor at harvard medical school and executive director of the center on media and child health in boston said of the digital generation their brains are rewarded not for staying on task but for jumping to the next thing the worry is were raising a generation of kids in front of screens whose brains are going to be wired differently students have always faced distractions computers and cell phones are a particular challenge because the stream of data can interfere with focusing and learning although these technologies affect adults too young people may be more influenced by it as their developing brains can easily become habituated to switching tasks and become unaccustomed to sustaining attention too much information coming too rapidly can overwhelm thinking technology is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains high exposure levels stimulate brain cell alteration and release neurotransmitters which causes the strengthening of some neural pathways and the weakening of others this leads to heightened stress levels on the brain that at first boost energy levels but over time actually augment memory impair cognition lead to depression and alter the neural circuitry of the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex these are the brain regions that control mood and thought if unchecked the underlying structure of the brain could be altered overstimulation due to technology may begin too young when children are exposed before the age of seven important developmental tasks may be delayed and bad learning habits might develop which deprives children of the exploration and play that they need to develop media psychology is an emerging specialty field that embraces electronic devices and the sensory behaviors occurring from the use of educational technology in learning sociocultural criticism according to lai the learning environment is a complex system where the interplay and interactions of many things impact the outcome of learning when technology is brought into an educational setting the pedagogical setting changes in that technologydriven teaching can change the entire meaning of an activity without adequate research validation if technology monopolizes an activity students can begin to develop the sense that life would scarcely be thinkable without technology leo marx considered the word technology itself as problematic susceptible to reification and phantom objectivity which conceals its fundamental nature as something that is only valuable insofar as it benefits the human condition technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil langdon winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the making versus the uses of new technologies and that a narrow focus on use leads us to believe that all technologies are neutral in moral standing ix39 these critiques would have us ask not how do we maximize the role or advancement of technology in education but rather what are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology winner viewed technology as a form of life that not only aids human activity but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning ix39 for example the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity but they also radically change the process of production itself thereby redefining what is meant by work in such a setting in education standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and assessment we rarely explicitly reflect on how strange a notion it is that a number between say 0 and 100 could accurately reflect a persons knowledge about the world according to winner the recurring patterns in everyday life tend to become an unconscious process that we learn to take for granted winner writes by far the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument system or technique is introduced because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment economic investment and social habit the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made in that sense technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political findings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations p 29 when adopting new technologies there may be one best chance to get it right seymour papert p 32 points out a good example of a bad choice that has become strongly fixed in social habit and material equipment our choice to use the qwerty keyboard the qwerty arrangement of letters on the keyboard was originally chosen not because it was the most efficient for typing but because early typewriters were prone to jam when adjacent keys were struck in quick succession now that typing has become a digital process this is no longer an issue but the qwerty arrangement lives on as a social habit one that is very difficult to change neil postman endorsed the notion that technology impacts human cultures including the culture of classrooms and that this is a consideration even more important than considering the efficiency of new technology as a tool for teaching regarding the computers impact on education postman writes p 19 what we need to consider about the computer has nothing to do with its efficiency as a teaching tool we need to know in what ways it is altering our conception of learning and how in conjunction with television it undermines the old idea of schoolthere is an assumption that technology is inherently interesting so it must be helpful in education based on research by daniel willingham that is not always the case he argues that it does not necessarily matter what the technological medium is but whether or not the content is engaging and utilizes the medium in a beneficial way digital divide the concept of the digital divide is a gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not access may be associated with age gender socioeconomic status education income ethnicity and geography data protection according to a report by the electronic frontier foundation large amounts of personal data on children are collected by electronic devices that are distributed in schools in the united states often far more information than necessary is collected uploaded and stored indefinitely aside from name and date of birth this information can include the childs browsing history search terms location data contact lists as well as behavioral information 5 parents are not informed or if informed have little choice 6 according to the report this constant surveillance resulting from educational technology can warp childrens privacy expectations lead them to selfcensor and limit their creativity 7 in a 2018 public service announcement the fbi warned that widespread collection of student information by educational technologies including web browsing history academic progress medical information and biometrics created the potential for privacy and safety threats if such data was compromised or exploited the transition from inperson learning to distance education in higher education due to the covid19 pandemic has led to enhanced extraction of student data enabled by complex data infrastructures these infrastructures collect information such as learning management system logins library metrics impact measurements teacher evaluation frameworks assessment systems learning analytic traces longitudinal graduate outcomes attendance records social media activity and so on the copious amounts of information collected are quantified for the marketization of higher education employing this data as a means to demonstrate and compare student performance across institutions to attract prospective students mirroring the capitalistic notion of ensuring efficient market functioning and constant improvement through measurement this desire of data has fueled the exploitation of higher education by platform companies and data service providers who are outsourced by institutions for their services the monetization of student data in order to integrate corporate models of marketization further pushes higher education widely regarded as a public good into a privatized commercial sector teacher training since technology is not the end goal of education but rather a means by which it can be accomplished educators must have a good grasp of the technology and its advantages and disadvantages teacher training aims for the effective integration of classroom technology the evolving nature of technology may unsettle teachers who may experience themselves as perpetual novices finding quality materials to support classroom objectives is often difficult random professional development days are inadequate according to jenkins rather than dealing with each technology in isolation we would do better to take an ecological approach thinking about the interrelationship among different communication technologies the cultural communities that grow up around them and the activities they support jenkins also suggested that the traditional school curriculum guided teachers to train students to be autonomous problem solvers however todays workers are increasingly asked to work in teams drawing on different sets of expertise and collaborating to solve problems learning styles and the methods of collecting information have evolved and students often feel locked out of the worlds described in their textbooks through the depersonalized and abstract prose used to describe them these twentyfirstcentury skills can be attained through the incorporation and engagement with technology changes in instruction and use of technology can also promote a higher level of learning among students with different types of intelligence assessment there are two distinct issues of assessment the assessment of educational technology and assessment with technology assessments of educational technology have included the follow through project educational assessment with technology may be either formative assessment or summative assessment instructors use both types of assessments to understand student progress and learning in the classroom technology has helped teachers create better assessments to help understand where students who are having trouble with the material are having issues formative assessment is more difficult as the perfect form is ongoing and allows the students to show their learning in different ways depending on their learning styles technology has helped some teachers make their formative assessments better particularly through the use of a classroom response system crs a crs is a tool in which the students each have a handheld device that partners up with the teachers computer the instructor then asks multiple choice or true or false questions and the students answer on their devices depending on the software used the answers may then be shown on a graph so students and the teacher can see the percentage of students who gave each answer and the teacher can focus on what went wrong classroom response systems have a history going back to late 1960s and early 1970s when analogue electronics were used in their implementations there were a few commercial products available but they were costly and some universities preferred to build their own the first such system appears to have been put into place at stanford university but it suffered from difficulties in use another early system was one designed and built by raphael m littauer a professor of physics at cornell university and used for large lecture courses it was more successful than most of the other early systems in part because the designer of the system was also the instructor using it a subsequent classroom response technologies involved hitt with infrared devices summative assessments are more common in classrooms and are usually set up to be more easily graded as they take the form of tests or projects with specific grading schemes one huge benefit of techbased testing is the option to give students immediate feedback on their answers when students get these responses they are able to know how they are doing in the class which can help push them to improve or give them confidence that they are doing well technology also allows for different kinds of summative assessment such as digital presentations videos or anything else the teacherstudents may come up with which allows different learners to show what they learned more effectively teachers can also use technology to post graded assessments online for students to have a better idea of what a good project is electronic assessment uses information technology it encompasses several potential applications which may be teacher or studentoriented including educational assessment throughout the continuum of learning such as computerized classification testing computerized adaptive testing student testing and grading an exam emarking is an examinerled activity closely related to other eassessment activities such as etesting or elearning which are studentled emarking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper there are no restrictions on the types of tests that can use emarking with emarking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice written and even video submissions for performance examinations emarking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organizations emarking has been used to mark many wellknown high stakes examinations which in the united kingdom include a levels and gcse exams and in the us includes the sat test for college admissions ofqual reports that emarking is the main type of marking used for general qualifications in the united kingdom in 2014 the scottish qualifications authority sqa announced that most of the national 5 question papers would be emarked in june 2015 the odisha state government in india announced that it planned to use emarking for all plus ii papers from 2016 analytics the importance of selfassessment through tools made available on educational technology platforms has been growing selfassessment in education technology relies on students analyzing their strengths weaknesses and areas where improvement is possible to set realistic goals in learning improve their educational performances and track their progress one of the unique tools for selfassessment made possible by education technology is analytics analytics is data gathered on the students activities on the learning platform drawn into meaningful patterns that lead to a valid conclusion usually through the medium of data visualization such as graphs learning analytics is the field that focuses on analyzing and reporting data about students activities in order to facilitate learning expenditure the five key sectors of the elearning industry are consulting content technologies services and support worldwide elearning was estimated in 2000 to be over 48 billion according to conservative estimates commercial growth has been brisk in 2014 the worldwide commercial market activity was estimated at 6 billion venture capital over the past five years 38 with selfpaced learning generating 356 billion in 2011 4 north american elearning generated 233 billion in revenue in 2013 with a 9 growth rate in cloudbased authoring tools and learning platforms 19 careers educational technologists and psychologists apply basic educational and psychological research into an evidencebased applied science or a technology of learning
