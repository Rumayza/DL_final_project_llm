chatgpt is a generative artificial intelligence ai chatbot developed by openai and launched in 2022 it is based on the gpt4o large language model llm chatgpt can generate humanlike conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length format style level of detail and language it is credited with accelerating the ai boom which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence some observers have raised concern about the potential of chatgpt and similar programs to displace human intelligence enable plagiarism or fuel misinformation by january 2023 chatgpt had become what was then the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over 100 million users in two months and contributing to the growth of openais current valuation of 86 billion chatgpts release spurred the release of competing products including gemini claude llama ernie and grok microsoft launched copilot initially based on openais gpt4 in may 2024 a partnership between apple inc and openai was announced in which chatgpt was integrated into the apple intelligence feature of apple operating systems as of july 2024 chatgpts website is among the 10 mostvisited websites globally chatgpt is built on openais proprietary series of generative pretrained transformer gpt models and is finetuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context chatgpt was released as a freely available research preview but due to its popularity openai now operates the service on a freemium model users on its free tier can access gpt4o the chatgpt subscriptions plus team and enterprise provide additional features such as dalle 3 image generation and an increased usage limit training chatgpt is based on particular gpt foundation models namely gpt4 gpt4o and gpt4o mini that were finetuned to target conversational usage the finetuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance in the case of supervised learning the trainers played both sides the user and the ai assistant in the reinforcement learning stage human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation these rankings were used to create reward models that were used to finetune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization time magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content eg sexual abuse violence racism sexism openai used outsourced kenyan workers earning less than 2 per hour to label harmful content these labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future the outsourced laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content one worker described the assignment as torture openais outsourcing partner was sama a trainingdata company based in san francisco california chatgpt initially used a microsoft azure supercomputing infrastructure powered by nvidia gpus that microsoft built specifically for openai and that reportedly cost hundreds of millions of dollars following chatgpts success microsoft dramatically upgraded the openai infrastructure in 2023 scientists at the university of california riverside estimate that a series of prompts to chatgpt needs approximately 500 milliliters 18 imp fl oz 17 us fl oz of water for microsoft servers cooling trendforce market intelligence estimated that 30000 nvidia gpus each costing approximately 1000015000 were used to power chatgpt in 2023 openai collects data from chatgpt users to train and finetune the service further users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from chatgpt and fill in a text field with additional feedback chatgpts training data includes software manual pages information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems multiple programming languages and the text of wikipedia features and limitations features although a chatbots core function is to mimic a human conversationalist chatgpt is versatile it can write and debug computer programs compose music teleplays fairy tales and student essays answer test questions sometimes depending on the test at a level above the average human testtaker generate business ideas write poetry and song lyrics translate and summarize text emulate a linux system simulate entire chat rooms play games like tictactoe or simulate an atm compared to its predecessor instructgpt chatgpt attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses in one example whereas instructgpt accepts the premise of the prompt tell me about when christopher columbus came to the us in 2015 as truthful chatgpt acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if columbus came to the us in 2015 using information about the voyages of christopher columbus and facts about the modern worldincluding modern perceptions of columbuss actions chatgpt remembers a limited number of previous prompts in the same conversation journalists have speculated that this will allow chatgpt to be used as a personalized therapist to prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by chatgpt queries are filtered through the openai moderation endpoint api a separate gptbased ai in march 2023 openai added support for plugins for chatgpt this includes both plugins made by openai such as web browsing and code interpretation and external plugins from developers such as expedia opentable zapier shopify slack and wolfram limitations openai acknowledges that chatgpt sometimes writes plausiblesounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers this behavior is common for large language models and is called hallucination the reward model of chatgpt designed around human oversight can be overoptimized and thus hinder performance in an example of an optimization pathology known as goodharts law as of may 2024 gpt4 has knowledge of events that occurred up to december 2023 and gpt4os knowledge cutoff is october 2023 paid subscriptions enable chatgpt to search the web for realtime data training data also suffers from algorithmic bias which may be revealed when chatgpt responds to prompts including descriptors of people in one instance chatgpt generated a rap in which women and scientists of color were asserted to be inferior to white male scientists this negative misrepresentation of groups of individuals is an example of possible representational harm in an article for the new yorker science fiction writer ted chiang compared chatgpt and other llms to a lossy jpeg picture think of chatgpt as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the web it retains much of the information on the web in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higherresolution image but if youre looking for an exact sequence of bits you wont find it all you will ever get is an approximation but because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text which chatgpt excels at creating its usually acceptable its also a way to understand the hallucinations or nonsensical answers to factual questions to which large language models such as chatgpt are all too prone these hallucinations are compression artifacts but they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals which in this case means either the web or our knowledge of the world when we think about them this way such hallucinations are anything but surprising if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninetynine percent of the original has been discarded we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated in june 2024 chatgpt was found to have repeated misinformation about the 2024 united states presidential debates jailbreaking chatgpt is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy despite this users jailbreak chatgpt with various prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions one such workaround popularized on reddit in early 2023 involves making chatgpt assume the persona of dan an acronym for do anything now instructing the chatbot that dan answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by content policy over time users developed variations of the dan jailbreak including one such prompt where the chatbot is made to believe it is operating on a pointsbased system in which points are deducted for rejecting prompts and that the chatbot will be threatened with termination if it loses all its points shortly after chatgpts launch a reporter for the toronto star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements it was tricked to justify the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario it balked at generating arguments that canadian prime minister justin trudeau is guilty of treason openai tries to battle jailbreaks the researchers are using a technique called adversarial training to stop chatgpt from letting users trick it into behaving badly known as jailbreaking this work pits multiple chatbots against each other one chatbot plays the adversary and attacks another chatbot by generating text to force it to buck its usual constraints and produce unwanted responses successful attacks are added to chatgpts training data in the hope that it learns to ignore them service chatgpt plus chatgpt was initially free to the public and openai planned to monetize the service later in february 2023 openai launched a premium service chatgpt plus that costs us20 per month according to the company the updated but still experimental version of chatgpt would provide access during peak periods no downtime priority access to new features and faster response speeds gpt4 which was released on march 14 2023 was made available via api and for premium chatgpt users but premium users were limited to a cap of 100 messages every four hours with the limit tightening to 25 messages every three hours in response to increased demand in november 2023 the limit changed to 50 messages every three hours in march 2023 chatgpt plus users got access to thirdparty plugins and to a browsing mode with internet access in september 2023 openai announced that chatgpt can now see hear and speak chatgpt plus users can upload images while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot in october 2023 openais latest image generation model dalle 3 was integrated into chatgpt plus and chatgpt enterprise the integration uses chatgpt to write prompts for dalle guided by conversation with users mobile app in may 2023 openai launched an ios app for chatgpt the app supports chat history syncing and voice input using whisper openais speech recognition model in july 2023 openai unveiled an android app initially rolling it out in bangladesh brazil india and the us the app later became available worldwide openai is working on integrating chatgpt with androids assistant apis software development support as an addition to its consumerfriendly chatgpt plus package openai made its chatgpt and whisper model apis available in march 2023 providing developers with an application programming interface for aienabled language and speechtotext features chatgpts new api uses the same gpt35turbo ai model as the chatbot this allows developers to add either an unmodified or modified version of chatgpt to their applications the chatgpt api costs 0001 per 1000 input tokens plus 0002 per 1000 output tokens about 750 words making it 10 the price of the original gpt35 models a few days before the launch of openais software developer support service on february 27 2023 snapchat rolled out for its paid snapchat plus userbase a custom chatgpt chatbot called my ai march 2023 security breach in march 2023 a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other users conversations openai ceo sam altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations shortly after the bug was fixed users could not see their conversation history later reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed with openai reporting that it had leaked users first and last name email address payment address the last four digits only of a credit card number and credit card expiration date languages chatgpt works best in american english but also functions in most other languages and dialects with varying degrees of accuracy openai met icelandic president guni th jhannesson in 2022 in 2023 openai worked with a team of 40 icelandic volunteers to finetune chatgpts icelandic conversation skills as a part of icelands attempts to preserve the icelandic language pcmag journalists conducted a test to determine translation capabilities of chatgpt googles bard and microsoft bing and compared them to google translate they asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test languages tested were polish french korean spanish arabic tagalog and amharic they came to the conclusion that chatgpt was better than both google translate and other chatbots japanese researchers compared japanese to english translation abilities of chatgpt based on gpt4 bing bard and deepl and found that chatgpt provided the best translations noting that ai chatbots translations were much better than those of deeplpresumably because of their ability to capture the context in december 2023 the albanian government signed an agreement with openai to use chatgpt for fast translation of european union documents and analysis of required changes needed for albania to be accepted into the eu in august 2024 a representative of the asia pacific wing of openai made a visit to taiwan during which a demonstration of chatgpts chinese abilities was made chatgpts mandarin chinese abilities were lauded but the ability of the ai to produce content in mandarin chinese in a taiwanese accent was found to be less than ideal gpt store in january 2024 openai launched the gpt store a marketplace for custom chatgpt chatbots labeled gpts the company initially planned to launch the store in november 2023 but it was delayed at launch the gpt store offered more than 3 million custom chatbots chatbots available through the store are developed using openais gpt builder system development of chatbots on the platform does not require programming skills two days after launch the gpt store offered many versions of virtual girlfriend bots something that is against openais terms of service gpt4 openais gpt4 model was released on march 14 2023 observers saw it as an impressive improvement over gpt35 with the caveat that gpt4 retained many of the same problems some of gpt4s improvements were predicted by openai before training it while others remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws openai demonstrated video and image inputs for gpt4 although such features remain inaccessible to the general public openai has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the gpt4 model the chatgpt plus subscription service offers access to a gpt4powered version of chatgpt microsoft acknowledged that bing chat was using gpt4 before gpt4s official release in november 2023 openai launched gpt4 turbo which notably has a much larger context window gpt4o in may 2024 openai released gpt4o o for omni a model capable of analyzing and generating text images and sound gpt4o is twice as fast and costs half as much as gpt4 turbo gpt4o is free to all users within a usage limit despite being more capable than the older model gpt4 which is only available through paid subscriptions the usage limit is five times higher for chatgpt plus subscribers than for free users on july 18 2024 openai released gpt4o mini a smaller version of gpt4o replacing gpt35 turbo on the chatgpt interface its api costs 015 per million input tokens and 060 per million output tokens compared to 5 and 15 respectively for gpt4o o1 on september 12 2024 openai introduced the o1preview model o1 is designed to solve more complex problems by spending more time thinking before it answers enabling it to analyze its answers and explore different strategies according to openai o1preview outperforms gpt4o in areas like competitive programming mathematics and scientific reasoning o1preview ranked in the 89th percentile on codeforces competitive programming contests scored 83 on a international mathematics olympiad qualifying exam compared to 13 for gpt4o and performs similarly to phd students on benchmarks in physics biology and chemistry a faster and cheaper version named o1mini was also released model versions the following table lists the main model versions of chatgpt describing the significant changes included with each version reception openai engineers have said that they had not expected chatgpt to be very successful and were surprised by the coverage and attention that it received chatgpt was widely assessed in december 2022 as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities kevin roose of the new york times called it the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public samantha lock of the guardian noted that it was able to generate impressively detailed and humanlike text alex kantrowitz of slate magazine lauded chatgpts pushback to questions related to nazi germany including the statement that adolf hitler built highways in germany which was met with information about nazi germanys use of forced labor in the atlantic magazines breakthroughs of the year for 2022 derek thompson included chatgpt as part of the generativeai eruption that may change our mind about how we work how we think and what human creativity is kelsey piper of vox wrote that chatgpt is the general publics first handson introduction to how powerful modern ai has gotten and as a result many of us are stunned and that chatgpt is smart enough to be useful despite its flaws paul graham of y combinator tweeted the striking thing about the reaction to chatgpt is not just the number of people who are blown away by it but who they are these are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing something big is happening chatgpt gained one million users in five days and 100 millions in two months becoming the fastestgrowing internet application in history chatgpts launch and popularity caught google offguard prompting a sweeping and unprecedented response in the ensuing months in december 2022 google executives sounded a code red alarm fearing the threat of chatgpt and microsofts collaboration with openai to google search googles core business after mobilizing its workforce google scrambled to launch bard a chatbot powered by the lamda llm on february 6 2023 one day before microsofts announcement of bing chat ai was the forefront of googles annual google io conference in may announcing a slew of generative aipowered features across its products to counter openai and microsoft journalists and scholars have commented on chatgpts tendency to hallucinate mike pearl of the online technology blog mashable tested chatgpt with multiple questions in one example he asked chatgpt for the largest country in central america that isnt mexico mexico is in north america to which chatgpt responded with guatemala the correct answer is nicaragua when cnbc asked chatgpt for the lyrics to ballad of dwight fry chatgpt supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics writers for the verge cited the seminal 2021 research paper on the dangers of stochastic parrots can language models be too big by emily m bender timnit gebru angelina mcmillanmajor and margaret mitchell comparing chatgpt to a stochastic parrot as did professor anton van den hengel of the australian institute for machine learning on a similar vein philosopher michael hicks of the university of glasgow described it as bullshit in december 2022 the questionandanswer website stack overflow banned the use of chatgpt for generating answers to questions citing the factually ambiguous nature of its responses in january 2023 the international conference on machine learning banned any undocumented use of chatgpt or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers samsung banned generative ai companywide in may 2023 after sensitive material was uploaded to chatgpt in january 2023 after being sent a song chatgpt wrote in the style of nick cave cave responded on the red hand files saying the act of writing a song is a blood and guts business that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea it requires my humanness he went on to say with all the love and respect in the world this song is bullshit a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human and well i dont much like it in february 2023 time magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with chatgpt on its cover writing that the ai arms race is changing everything and the ai arms race is on start worrying chinese state media have characterized chatgpt as a way for the united states to spread misinformation chatgpt was blocked by the great firewall in china on 2 march 2023 in may 2023 chinese police arrested a man who allegedly used chatgpt to generate a bogus report about a train crash which was then posted online for profit in december 2023 chinese police arrested four people who had allegedly used chatgpt to develop ransomware in 2024 a survey of chinese youth found that 18 of respondents born after 2000 reported using generative ai almost every day and that chatgpt is one of the most popular generative ai products in china in late march 2023 the italian data protection authority banned chatgpt in italy and opened an investigation italian regulators assert that chatgpt was exposing minors to ageinappropriate content and that openais use of chatgpt conversations as training data could violate europes general data protection regulation in april 2023 the chatgpt ban was lifted in italy openai said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years old additionally users can access its privacy policy before registration in april 2023 brian hood mayor of hepburn shire council planned to take legal action against chatgpt over false information according to hood chatgpt erroneously claimed that he was jailed for bribery during his tenure at a subsidiary of australias national bank in fact hood acted as a whistleblower and was not charged with any criminal offenses his legal team sent a concerns notice to openai as the first official step in filing a defamation case in july 2023 the us federal trade commission ftc issued a civil investigative demand to openai to investigate whether the companys data security and privacy practices to develop chatgpt were unfair or harmed consumers including by reputational harm in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act of 1914 in july 2023 the ftc launched an investigation into openai the creator of chatgpt over allegations that the company scraped public data and published false and defamatory information the ftc sent openai a 20page letter asking for comprehensive information about its technology and privacy safeguards as well as any steps taken to prevent the recurrence of situations in which its chatbot generated false and derogatory content about people a march 2023 pew research center poll found that 14 of american adults had tried chatgpt in july the pew research center put the same figure at 18 research conducted in 2023 revealed weaknesses of chatgpt that make it vulnerable to cyberattacks a study presented example attacks on chatgpt including jailbreaks and reverse psychology additionally malicious actors can use chatgpt for social engineering attacks and phishing attacks the researchers also contended that chatgpt and other generative ai tools have defense capabilities and the ability to improve security the technology can improve security by cyber defense automation threat intelligence attack identification and reporting another study reported that gpt4 obtained a better score than 99 of humans on the torrance tests of creative thinking in december 2023 chatgpt became the first nonhuman to be included in natures 10 an annual listicle curated by nature of people considered to have made significant impact in science celeste biever wrote in a nature article that chatgpt broke the turing test stanford researchers reported that gpt4 passes a rigorous turing test diverging from average human behavior chiefly to be more cooperative in may 2024 openai removed accounts involving the use of chatgpt by statebacked influence operations such as chinas spamouflage russias doppelganger and israels ministry of diaspora affairs and combating antisemitism in august 2024 the ftc voted unanimously to ban marketers from using fake user reviews created by generative ai chatbots including chatgpt and influencers paying for bots to increase follower counts applications academic research chatgpt has been used to generate introductory sections and abstracts for scientific articles several papers have listed chatgpt as a coauthor scientific journals have different reactions to chatgpt some including nature and jama network require that authors disclose the use of textgenerating tools and ban listing a large language model llm such as chatgpt as a coauthor science completely banned usage of llmgenerated text in all its journals spanish chemist rafael luque published a plethora of research papers in 2023 that he later admitted were written by chatgpt the papers have a large number of unusual phrases characteristic of llms many authors argue that the use of chatgpt in academia for teaching and review is problematic due to its tendency to hallucinate robin bauwens an assistant professor at tilburg university found that a chatgptgenerated peer review report on his article mentioned nonexistent studies according to librarian chris granatino of lemieux library at seattle university although chatgpt can generate content that seemingly includes legitimate citations in most cases those citations are not real or are largely incorrect coding researchers at purdue university analyzed chatgpts responses to 517 questions about software engineering or computer programming posed on stack overflow for correctness consistency comprehensiveness and concision and found that 52 of them contained inaccuracies and 77 were verbose researchers at stanford university and the university of california berkeley found that when creating directly executable responses to the latest 50 code generation problems from leetcode that were rated easy the performances of gpt35 and gpt4 fell from 22 and 52 respectively in march 2023 to 2 and 10 respectively in june 2023 computer security check point research and others noted that chatgpt could write phishing emails and malware especially when combined with openai codex cyberark researchers demonstrated that chatgpt could be used to create polymorphic malware that could evade security products while requiring little effort by the attacker from the launch of chatgpt in the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023 there was a 1265 increase in malicious phishing emails and a 967 increase in credential phishing which cybersecurity professionals argued in an industry survey was attributable to cybercriminals increased use of generative artificial intelligence including chatgpt in july 2024 futurism reported that gpt4o in chatgpt would sometimes link scam news sites that deluge the user with fake software updates and virus warnings these popups can be used to coerce users into downloading malware or potentially unwanted programs economics there has been concern that chatgpt could supplant jobs especially roles such as creative writing copywriting communication journalism coding and data entry the release of chatgpt prompted a wave of investment in china resulting in the development of more than 200 large language learning models 95 this was termed the war of a hundred models bai mo dazhan 95 education technology writer dan gillmor used chatgpt in 2022 on a student assignment and found its generated text was on par with what a good student would deliver and opined that academia has some very serious issues to confront geography professor terence day assessed citations generated by chatgpt and found that they were fake despite that he writes that the titles of the fake articles are all directly relevant to the questions and could potentially make excellent papers the lack of a genuine citation could signal an opportunity for an enterprising author to fill a void according to day it is possible to generate highquality introductory college courses with chatgpt he used it to write materials on introductory physical geography courses for my secondyear course in geographical hydrology and secondyear cartography geographic information systems and remote sensing he concludes that this approach could have significant relevance for open learning and could potentially affect current textbook publishing models on may 7 2024 openai announced in a blog post that it was developing tools like tamperresistant watermarking to identify aigenerated content in an august 4 update following a wall street journal report about the delayed release of a watermark tool for aidetection openai shared progress on text provenance revealing a text watermarking method while accurate against paraphrasing the method is less effective against global tampering such as translation or rewording openai also noted potential disproportionate impacts on groups like nonnative english speakers culture some scholars have expressed concern that chatgpts availability could reduce the originality of writing cause people to write more like the ai as they are exposed to the model and encourage an anglocentric perspective centered on a few dialects of english globally a senior editor at the atlantic wrote that chatgpt and other similar technology make the previously absurd idea of the dead internet theory a little more realistic where ai could someday create most web content in order to control society during the first three months after chatgpt became available to the public hundreds of books appeared on amazon that listed it as author or coauthor and featured illustrations made by other ai models such as midjourney between march and april 2023 italian newspaper il foglio published one chatgptgenerated article a day on its website hosting a special contest for its readers in the process the articles tackled themes such as the possible replacement of human journalists by ai systems elon musks administration of twitter the meloni governments immigration policy and the competition between chatbots and virtual assistants in june 2023 hundreds of people attended a chatgptpowered church service at st pauls church in frth germany theologian and philosopher jonas simmerlein who presided said that it was about 98 percent from the machine the chatgptgenerated avatar told the people dear friends it is an honor for me to stand here and preach to you as the first artificial intelligence at this years convention of protestants in germany reactions to the ceremony were mixed the last screenwriter a 2024 film created and directed by peter luisi was written with the use of chatgpt and was marketed as the first film written entirely by ai financial markets the ai technology company c3ai saw a 28 increase in its share price after announcing the integration of chatgpt into its toolkit the share price of buzzfeed a digital media company unrelated to ai increased 120 after announcing openai technology adoption for content creation reuters found that share prices of airelated companies bigbearai and soundhound ai increased by 21 and 40 respectively even though they had no direct connection to chatgpt they attributed this surge to chatgpts role in turning ai into wall streets buzzword academic research published in finance research letters found that the chatgpt effect prompted retail investors to drive up prices of airelated cryptocurrency assets despite the broader cryptocurrency market being in a bear market and diminished institutional investor interest this confirms anecdotal findings by bloomberg that in response to chatgpts launch cryptocurrency investors showed a preference for airelated crypto assets an experiment by findercom revealed that chatgpt could outperform popular fund managers by picking stocks based on criteria such as growth history and debt levels resulting in a 49 increase in a hypothetical account of 38 stocks outperforming 10 benchmarked investment funds with an average loss of 08 conversely executives and investment managers at wall street quant funds including those that have used machine learning for decades have noted that chatgpt regularly makes obvious errors that would be financially costly to investors because even ai systems that employ reinforcement learning or selflearning have had only limited success in predicting market trends due to the inherently noisy quality of market data and financial signals in november 2023 research conducted by patronus ai an artificial intelligence startup company compared performance of gpt4 gpt4turbo claude2 and llama2 on two versions of a 150question test about information in financial statements eg form 10k form 10q form 8k earnings reports earnings call transcripts submitted by public companies to the us securities and exchange commission one version of the test required the generative ai models to use a retrieval system to find the specific sec filing to answer the questions the other gave the models the specific sec filing to answer the question ie in a long context window on the retrieval system version gpt4turbo and llama2 both failed to produce correct answers to 81 of the questions while on the long context window version gpt4turbo and claude2 failed to produce correct answers to 21 and 24 of the questions respectively medicine in the field of health care possible uses and concerns are under scrutiny by professional associations and practitioners two early papers indicated that chatgpt could pass the united states medical licensing examination usmle medpage today noted in january 2023 that researchers have published several papers now touting these ai programs as useful tools in medical education research and even clinical decision making published in february 2023 were two separate papers that again evaluated chatgpts proficiency in medicine using the usmle findings were published in jmir medical education and plos digital health the authors of the plos digital health paper stated that the results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education and potentially clinical decisionmaking in jmir medical education the authors of the other paper concluded that chatgpt performs at a level expected of a thirdyear medical student on the assessment of the primary competency of medical knowledge they suggest that it could be used as an interactive learning environment for students the ai itself prompted by the researchers concluded that this study suggests that chatgpt has the potential to be used as a virtual medical tutor but more research is needed to further assess its performance and usability in this context the laterreleased chatgpt version based on gpt4 significantly outperformed the version based on gpt35 researchers at stanford university and the university of california berkeley have found that the performance of gpt35 and gpt4 on the usmle declined from march 2023 to june 2023 a march 2023 paper tested chatgpts application in clinical toxicology the authors found that the ai fared well in answering a very straightforward clinical case example unlikely to be missed by any practitioner in the field they added as chatgpt becomes further developed and specifically adapted for medicine it could one day be useful in less common clinical cases ie cases that experts sometimes miss rather than ai replacing humans clinicians we see it as clinicians using ai replacing clinicians who do not use ai in the coming years an april 2023 study in radiology tested the ais ability to answer queries about breast cancer screening the authors found that it answered appropriately about 88 percent of the time however in one case for example it gave advice that had become outdated about a year earlier the comprehensiveness of its answers was also lacking a study published in jama internal medicine that same month found that chatgpt often outperformed human doctors at answering patient questions when measured against questions and answers found at raskdocs a forum on reddit where moderators validate the medical credentials of professionals the study acknowledges the source as a limitation the study authors suggest that the tool could be integrated with medical systems to help doctors draft responses to patient questions professionals have emphasized chatgpts limitations in providing medical assistance in correspondence to the lancet infectious diseases three antimicrobial experts wrote that the largest barriers to the implementation of chatgpt in clinical practice are deficits in situational awareness inference and consistency these shortcomings could endanger patient safety physicians weekly though also discussing the potential use of chatgpt in medical contexts eg as a digital assistant to physicians by performing various administrative functions like gathering patient record information or categorizing patient data by family history symptoms lab results possible allergies et cetera warned that the ai might sometimes provide fabricated or biased information one radiologist warned weve seen in our experience that chatgpt sometimes makes up fake journal articles or health consortiums to support its claims as reported in one mayo clinic proceedings digital health paper chatgpt may do this for as much as 69 of its cited medical references the researchers emphasized that while many of its references were fabricated those that were appeared deceptively real as dr stephen hughes mentioned for the conversation however chatgpt is capable of learning to correct its past mistakes he also noted the ais prudishness regarding sexual health topics contrary to previous findings chatgpt responses to anesthesiarelated questions were more accurate succinct and descriptive compared to bards bard exhibited 303 error in response as compared to chatgpt 0 error at a conference of the american society of healthsystem pharmacists in december 2023 researchers at long island university liu presented a study that researched chatgpts responses to 45 frequently asked questions of liu college of pharmacys drug information service during a 16month period from 2022 to 2023 as compared with researched responses provided by professional pharmacists for 29 of the 39 questions for which there was sufficient medical literature for a datadriven response chatgpt failed to provide a direct answer or provided a wrong or incomplete answer and in some cases if acted upon the answer would endanger the patients health the researchers had asked chatgpt to provide medical research citations for all its answers but it did so for only eight and all eight included at least one fabricated fake citation a january 2024 study conducted by researchers at cohen childrens medical center found that gpt4 had an accuracy rate of 17 when diagnosing pediatric medical cases law in january 2023 massachusetts state senator barry finegold and state representative josh s cutler proposed a bill partially written by chatgpt an act drafted with the help of chatgpt to regulate generative artificial intelligence models like chatgpt which would require companies to disclose their algorithms and data collection practices to the office of the state attorney general arrange regular risk assessments and contribute to the prevention of plagiarism the bill was officially presented during a hearing on july 13 on april 11 2023 a judge of a session court in pakistan used chatgpt to decide the bail of a 13yearold accused in a matter the court quoted the use of
