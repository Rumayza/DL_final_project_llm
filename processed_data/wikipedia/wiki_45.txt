the philosophy of artificial intelligence is a branch of the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of computer science that explores artificial intelligence and its implications for knowledge and understanding of intelligence ethics consciousness epistemology and free will furthermore the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people or at least artificial creatures see artificial life so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers these factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence the philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows can a machine act intelligently can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same is the human brain essentially a computer can a machine have a mind mental states and consciousness in the same sense that a human being can can it feel how things are ie does it have qualia questions like these reflect the divergent interests of ai researchers cognitive scientists and philosophers respectively the scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of intelligence and consciousness and exactly which machines are under discussion important propositions in the philosophy of ai include some of the following turings polite convention if a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being then it is as intelligent as a human being the dartmouth proposal every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it allen newell and herbert a simons physical symbol system hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action john searles strong ai hypothesis the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds hobbes mechanism for reason is nothing but reckoning that is adding and subtracting of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the marking and signifying of our thoughts can a machine display general intelligence is it possible to create a machine that can solve all the problems humans solve using their intelligence this question defines the scope of what machines could do in the future and guides the direction of ai research it only concerns the behavior of machines and ignores the issues of interest to psychologists cognitive scientists and philosophers evoking the question does it matter whether a machine is really thinking as a person thinks rather than just producing outcomes that appear to result from thinking the basic position of most ai researchers is summed up in this statement which appeared in the proposal for the dartmouth workshop of 1956 every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working ai system is impossible because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for intelligent behavior and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine or by the methods of current ai research arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible it is also possible to sidestep the connection between the two parts of the above proposal for instance machine learning beginning with turings infamous child machine proposal essentially achieves the desired feature of intelligence without a precise designtime description as to how it would exactly work the account on robot tacit knowledge eliminates the need for a precise description altogether the first step to answering the question is to clearly define intelligence intelligence turing test alan turing reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation he suggests that if a machine can answer any question posed to it using the same words that an ordinary person would then we may call that machine intelligent a modern version of his experimental design would use an online chat room where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program the program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human turing notes that no one except philosophers ever asks the question can people think he writes instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks turings test extends this polite convention to machines if a machine acts as intelligently as a human being then it is as intelligent as a human being one criticism of the turing test is that it only measures the humanness of the machines behavior rather than the intelligence of the behavior since human behavior and intelligent behavior are not exactly the same thing the test fails to measure intelligence stuart j russell and peter norvig write that aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons intelligence as achieving goals twentyfirst century ai research defines intelligence in terms of goaldirected behavior it views intelligence as a set of problems that the machine is expected to solve the more problems it can solve and the better its solutions are the more intelligent the program is ai founder john mccarthy defined intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world stuart russell and peter norvig formalized this definition using abstract intelligent agents an agent is something which perceives and acts in an environment a performance measure defines what counts as success for the agent if an agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge then it is intelligent definitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence they have the advantage that unlike the turing test they do not also test for unintelligent human traits such as making typing mistakes they have the disadvantage that they can fail to differentiate between things that think and things that do not by this definition even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence arguments that a machine can display general intelligence the brain can be simulated hubert dreyfus describes this argument as claiming that if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry which we have every reason to suppose it does then we ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device this argument first introduced as early as 1943 and vividly described by hans moravec in 1988 is now associated with futurist ray kurzweil who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year 2029 a nonrealtime simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain 1011 neurons was performed in 2005 and it took 50 days to simulate 1 second of brain dynamics on a cluster of 27 processors even ais harshest critics such as hubert dreyfus and john searle agree that a brain simulation is possible in theory however searle points out that in principle anything can be simulated by a computer thus bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered computation what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers he writes thus merely simulating the functioning of a living brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind like trying to build a jet airliner by copying a living bird precisely feather by feather with no theoretical understanding of aeronautical engineering human thinking is symbol processing in 1963 allen newell and herbert a simon proposed that symbol manipulation was the essence of both human and machine intelligence they wrote a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action this claim is very strong it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence and that machines can be intelligent because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence another version of this position was described by philosopher hubert dreyfus who called it the psychological assumption the mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules the symbols that newell simon and dreyfus discussed were wordlike and high levelsymbols that directly correspond with objects in the world such as dog and tail most ai programs written between 1956 and 1990 used this kind of symbol modern ai based on statistics and mathematical optimization does not use the highlevel symbol processing that newell and simon discussed arguments against symbol processing these arguments show that human thinking does not consist solely of high level symbol manipulation they do not show that artificial intelligence is impossible only that more than symbol processing is required gdelian antimechanist arguments in 1931 kurt gdel proved with an incompleteness theorem that it is always possible to construct a gdel statement that a given consistent formal system of logic such as a highlevel symbol manipulation program could not prove despite being a true statement the constructed gdel statement is unprovable in the given system the truth of the constructed gdel statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed but will actually yield a false gdel statement instead more speculatively gdel conjectured that the human mind can eventually correctly determine the truth or falsity of any wellgrounded mathematical statement including any possible gdel statement and that therefore the human minds power is not reducible to a mechanism philosopher john lucas since 1961 and roger penrose since 1989 have championed this philosophical antimechanist argument gdelian antimechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuousseeming claim that a system of human mathematicians or some idealization of human mathematicians is both consistent completely free of error and believes fully in its own consistency and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency including belief in its gdel statement this is probably impossible for a turing machine to do see halting problem therefore the gdelian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured by a turing machine and by extension any digital mechanical device however the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent that any consistent idealized version h of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counterintuitive openminded skepticism about the consistency of h otherwise h is provably inconsistent and that gdels theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate this consensus that gdelian antimechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in artificial intelligence any attempt to utilize gdels incompleteness results to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis stuart russell and peter norvig agree that gdels argument does not consider the nature of realworld human reasoning it applies to what can theoretically be proved given an infinite amount of memory and time in practice real machines including humans have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems it is not necessary to be able to prove everything in order to be an intelligent person less formally douglas hofstadter in his pulitzer prize winning book gdel escher bach an eternal golden braid states that these gdelstatements always refer to the system itself drawing an analogy to the way the epimenides paradox uses statements that refer to themselves such as this statement is false or i am lying but of course the epimenides paradox applies to anything that makes statements whether it is a machine or a human even lucas himself consider lucas cant assert the truth of this statement this statement is true but cannot be asserted by lucas this shows that lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines as are all people and so lucass argument is pointless after concluding that human reasoning is noncomputable penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical noncomputable processes involving the collapse of quantum mechanical states give humans a special advantage over existing computers existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of turing machines by penrose and lucass arguments the fact that quantum computers are only able to complete turing computable tasks implies that they cannot be sufficient for emulating the human mind therefore penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the planck mass via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function these states he suggested occur both within neurons and also spanning more than one neuron however other scientists point out that there is no plausible organic mechanism in the brain for harnessing any sort of quantum computation and furthermore that the timescale of quantum decoherence seems too fast to influence neuron firing dreyfus the primacy of implicit skills hubert dreyfus argued that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on fast intuitive judgements rather than stepbystep symbolic manipulation and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules dreyfuss argument had been anticipated by turing in his 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence where he had classified this as the argument from the informality of behavior turing argued in response that just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior this does not mean that no such rules exist he wrote we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour the only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say we have searched enough there are no such laws russell and norvig point out that in the years since dreyfus published his critique progress has been made towards discovering the rules that govern unconscious reasoning the situated movement in robotics research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention computational intelligence paradigms such as neural nets evolutionary algorithms and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning statistical approaches to ai can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses research into commonsense knowledge has focused on reproducing the background or context of knowledge in fact ai research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation towards new models that are intended to capture more of our intuitive reasoning cognitive science and psychology eventually came to agree with dreyfus description of human expertise daniel kahnemann and others developed a similar theory where they identified two systems that humans use to solve problems which he called system 1 fast intuitive judgements and system 2 slow deliberate step by step thinking although dreyfus views have been vindicated in many ways the work in cognitive science and in ai was in response to specific problems in those fields and was not directly influenced by dreyfus historian and ai researcher daniel crevier wrote that time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of dreyfuss comments had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier can a machine have a mind consciousness and mental states this is a philosophical question related to the problem of other minds and the hard problem of consciousness the question revolves around a position defined by john searle as strong ai a physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states searle distinguished this position from what he called weak ai a physical symbol system can act intelligently searle introduced the terms to isolate strong ai from weak ai so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue he argued that even if we assume that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered neither of searles two positions are of great concern to ai research since they do not directly answer the question can a machine display general intelligence unless it can also be shown that consciousness is necessary for intelligence turing wrote i do not wish to give the impression that i think there is no mystery about consciousness but i do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question of whether machines can think russell and norvig agree most ai researchers take the weak ai hypothesis for granted and dont care about the strong ai hypothesis there are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence such as igor aleksander stan franklin ron sun and pentti haikonen although their definition of consciousness strays very close to intelligence see artificial consciousness before we can answer this question we must be clear what we mean by minds mental states and consciousness consciousness minds mental states meaning the words mind and consciousness are used by different communities in different ways some new age thinkers for example use the word consciousness to describe something similar to bergsons lan vital an invisible energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind science fiction writers use the word to describe some essential property that makes us human a machine or alien that is conscious will be presented as a fully human character with intelligence desires will insight pride and so on science fiction writers also use the words sentience sapience selfawareness or ghostas in the ghost in the shell manga and anime seriesto describe this essential human property for others the words mind or consciousness are used as a kind of secular synonym for the soul for philosophers neuroscientists and cognitive scientists the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane they refer to the familiar everyday experience of having a thought in your head like a perception a dream an intention or a plan and to the way we see something know something mean something or understand something its not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness observes philosopher john searle what is mysterious and fascinating is not so much what it is but how it is how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this familiar experience of perceiving meaning or thinking philosophers call this the hard problem of consciousness it is the latest version of a classic problem in the philosophy of mind called the mindbody problem a related problem is the problem of meaning or understanding which philosophers call intentionality what is the connection between our thoughts and what we are thinking about ie objects and situations out in the world a third issue is the problem of experience or phenomenology if two people see the same thing do they have the same experience or are there things inside their head called qualia that can be different from person to person neurobiologists believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the neural correlates of consciousness the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties such as the mind experience and understanding some of the harshest critics of artificial intelligence agree that the brain is just a machine and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain the difficult philosophical question is this can a computer program running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one duplicate the ability of the neurons to create minds with mental states like understanding or perceiving and ultimately the experience of consciousness arguments that a computer cannot have a mind and mental states searles chinese room john searle asks us to consider a thought experiment suppose we have written a computer program that passes the turing test and demonstrates general intelligent action suppose specifically that the program can converse in fluent chinese write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak chinese lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards he will copy out chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot from the outside it will appear that the chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks chinese the question is this is there anyone or anything in the room that understands chinese that is is there anything that has the mental state of understanding or which has conscious awareness of what is being discussed in chinese the man is clearly not aware the room cannot be aware the cards certainly are not aware searle concludes that the chinese room or any other physical symbol system cannot have a mind searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and consciousness require yet to be described actual physicalchemical properties of actual human brains he argues there are special causal properties of brains and neurons that gives rise to minds in his words brains cause minds related arguments leibniz mill daviss telephone exchange blocks chinese nation and blockhead gottfried leibniz made essentially the same argument as searle in 1714 using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill in 1974 lawrence davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people and in 1978 ned block envisioned the entire population of china involved in such a brain simulation this thought experiment is called the chinese nation or the chinese gym ned block also proposed his blockhead argument which is a version of the chinese room in which the program has been refactored into a simple set of rules of the form see this do that removing all mystery from the program responses to the chinese room responses to the chinese room emphasize several different points the systems reply and the virtual mind reply this reply argues that the system including the man the program the room and the cards is what understands chinese searle claims that the man in the room is the only thing which could possibly have a mind or understand but others disagree arguing that it is possible for there to be two minds in the same physical place similar to the way a computer can simultaneously be two machines at once one physical like a macintosh and one virtual like a word processor speed power and complexity replies several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question and would require filing cabinets of astronomical proportions this brings the clarity of searles intuition into doubt robot reply to truly understand some believe the chinese room needs eyes and hands hans moravec writes if we could graft a robot to a reasoning program we wouldnt need a person to provide the meaning anymore it would come from the physical world brain simulator reply what if the program simulates the sequence of nerve firings at the synapses of an actual brain of an actual chinese speaker the man in the room would be simulating an actual brain this is a variation on the systems reply that appears more plausible because the system now clearly operates like a human brain which strengthens the intuition that there is something besides the man in the room that could understand chinese other minds reply and the epiphenomena reply several people have noted that searles argument is just a version of the problem of other minds applied to machines since it is difficult to decide if people are actually thinking we should not be surprised that it is difficult to answer the same question about machines a related question is whether consciousness as searle understands it exists searle argues that the experience of consciousness cannot be detected by examining the behavior of a machine a human being or any other animal daniel dennett points out that natural selection cannot preserve a feature of an animal that has no effect on the behavior of the animal and thus consciousness as searle understands it cannot be produced by natural selection therefore either natural selection did not produce consciousness or strong ai is correct in that consciousness can be detected by suitably designed turing test is thinking a kind of computation the computational theory of mind or computationalism claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar if not identical to the relationship between a running program software and a computer hardware the idea has philosophical roots in hobbes who claimed reasoning was nothing more than reckoning leibniz who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas hume who thought perception could be reduced to atomic impressions and even kant who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules the latest version is associated with philosophers hilary putnam and jerry fodor this question bears on our earlier questions if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious answering both the practical and philosophical questions of ai in terms of the practical question of ai can a machine display general intelligence some versions of computationalism make the claim that as hobbes wrote reasoning is nothing but reckoning in other words our intelligence derives from a form of calculation similar to arithmetic this is the physical symbol system hypothesis discussed above and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible in terms of the philosophical question of ai can a machine have mind mental states and consciousness most versions of computationalism claim that as stevan harnad characterizes it mental states are just implementations of the right computer programs this is john searles strong ai discussed above and it is the real target of the chinese room argument according to harnad other related questions can a machine have emotions if emotions are defined only in terms of their effect on behavior or on how they function inside an organism then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an intelligent agent uses to maximize the utility of its actions given this definition of emotion hans moravec believes that robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people fear is a source of urgency empathy is a necessary component of good human computer interaction he says robots will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement you can interpret this as a kind of love daniel crevier writes moravecs point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of ones species can a machine be selfaware selfawareness as noted above is sometimes used by science fiction writers as a name for the essential human property that makes a character fully human turing strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to can a machine be the subject of its own thought can it think about itself viewed in this way a program can be written that can report on its own internal states such as a debugger can a machine be original or creative turing reduces this to the question of whether a machine can take us by surprise and argues that this is obviously true as any programmer can attest he notes that with enough storage capacity a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways it must be possible even trivial for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways douglas lenats automated mathematician as one example combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths kaplan and haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned in 2009 scientists at aberystwyth university in wales and the uks university of cambridge designed a robot called adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings also in 2009 researchers at cornell developed eureqa a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulums motion can a machine be benevolent or hostile this question like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence can be presented in two forms hostility can be defined in terms function or behavior in which case hostile becomes synonymous with dangerous or it can be defined in terms of intent can a machine deliberately set out to do harm the latter is the question can a machine have conscious states such as intentions in another form the question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists such as the machine intelligence research institute the obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in science fiction which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind see artificial intelligence in fiction one issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly vernor vinge has suggested that over just a few years computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans he calls this the singularity he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism in 2009 academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become selfsufficient and able to make their own decisions they discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard they noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semiautonomy including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved cockroach intelligence they noted that selfawareness as depicted in sciencefiction is probably unlikely but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions the us navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions the president of the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence has commissioned a study to look at this issue they point to programs like the language acquisition device which can emulate human interaction some have suggested a need to build friendly ai a term coined by eliezer yudkowsky meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane can a machine imitate all human characteristics turing said it is customary to offer a grain of comfort in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine i cannot offer any such comfort for i believe that no such bounds can be set turing noted that there are many arguments of the form a machine will never do x where x can be many things such as be kind resourceful beautiful friendly have initiative have a sense of humor tell right from wrong make mistakes fall in love enjoy strawberries and cream make someone fall in love with it learn from experience use words properly be the subject of its own thought have as much diversity of behaviour as a man do something really new turing argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are disguised forms of the argument from consciousness writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors will not make much of an impression all of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of ai unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence can a machine have a soul finally those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that thinking is a function of mans immortal soul alan turing called this the theological objection he writes in attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping his power of creating souls any more than we are in the procreation of children rather we are in either case instruments of his will providing mansions for the souls that he createsthe discussion on the topic has been reignited as a result of recent claims made by googles lamda artificial intelligence system that it is sentient and had a soul lamda language model for dialogue applications is an artificial intelligence system that creates chatbotsai robots designed to communicate with humansby gathering vast amounts of text from the internet and using algorithms to respond to queries in the most fluid and natural way possible the transcripts of conversations between scientists and lamda reveal that the ai system excels at this providing answers to challenging topics about the nature of emotions generating aesopstyle fables on the moment and even describing its alleged fears pretty much all philosophers doubt lamdas sentience views on the role of philosophy some scholars argue that the ai communitys dismissal of philosophy is detrimental in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy some philosophers argue that the role of philosophy in ai is underappreciated physicist david deutsch argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts ai development would suffer from a lack of progress conferences and literature the main conference series on the issue is philosophy and theory of ai ptai run by vincent c mller the main bibliography on the subject with several subsections is on philpapers a recent survey for philosophy of ai is mller 2023
