a cryptocurrency cryptocurrency or crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority such as a government or bank to uphold or maintain it individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership despite the term that has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdicitons including classification as commodities securities and currencies cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin which was first released as opensource software in 2009 as of june 2023 there were more than 25000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding 1 billion history in 1983 american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash later in 1995 he implemented it through digicash an early form of cryptographic electronic payments digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party in 1996 the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash describing a cryptocurrency system the paper was first published in an mit mailing list october 1996 and later april 1997 in the american law review in 1998 wei dai described bmoney an anonymous distributed electronic cash system shortly thereafter nick szabo described bit gold like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it bit gold not to be confused with the later goldbased exchange bitgold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published in january 2009 bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto it used sha256 a cryptographic hash function in its proofofwork scheme in april 2011 namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns in october 2011 litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha256 peercoin created in august 2012 used a hybrid of proofofwork and proofofstake cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction including several bubbles and market crashes such as in 2011 2013201415 20172018 and 20212023 on 6 august 2014 the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role if any they could play in the uk economy the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered its final report was published in 2018 and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january 2021 in june 2021 el salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender after the legislative assembly had voted 6222 to pass a bill submitted by president nayib bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such in august 2021 cuba followed with resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in september 2021 the government of china the single largest market for cryptocurrency declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal this completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within china on 15 september 2022 the worlds second largest cryptocurrency at that time ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proofofwork pow to proofofstake pos in an upgrade process known as the merge according to the ethereum founder the upgrade would cut both ethereums energy use and carbondioxide emissions by 999 on 11 november 2022 ftx trading ltd a cryptocurrency exchange which also operated a crypto hedge fund and had been valued at 18 billion filed for bankruptcy the financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate ftx customer base as reported while at a reuters conference financial industry executives said that regulators must step in to protect crypto investors technology analyst avivah litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that everythingneeds to improve dramatically in terms of user experience controls safety customer service formal definition according to jan lansky a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions the system does not require a central authority its state is maintained through distributed consensus the system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership the system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created if new cryptocurrency units can be created the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically the system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed a transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units if two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered the system performs at most one of them in march 2018 the word cryptocurrency was added to the merriamwebster dictionary altcoins after the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin tokens cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins sometimes the term alt coins was used or disparagingly shitcoins paul vigna of the wall street journal described altcoins in 2020 as alternative versions of bitcoin given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers a polytechnic university of catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin as of early 2020 there were more than 5000 cryptocurrencies altcoin is the combination of two words alt and coin and includes all alternatives to bitcoin 14 altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin for example litecoin aims to process a block every 25 minutes rather than bitcoins 10 minutes which allows litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin another example is ethereum which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020 according to bloomberg news in 2016 it had the largest following of any altcoin according to the new york times significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an altseason stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power notably these designs are not foolproof as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg for example on 11 may 2022 terras stablecoin ust fell from 1 to 26 cents the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly 40b invested in the terra and luna coins in september 2022 south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the companys founder do kwon in hong kong the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 202324 is being shaped and includes a few considerations memecoins memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from internet memes or jokes the most notable example is dogecoin a memecoin featuring the shiba inu dog from the doge meme memecoins are known for extreme volatility for example the recordhigh value for a dogecoin was 73 cents but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid2024 scams are prolific among memecoins physical crypto physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars there have also been attempts to issue bitcoin bank notes the term physical bitcoin is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a custodian these physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves these are only utilized for collectable purposes architecture cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated in centralized banking and economic systems such as the us federal reserve system corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency in the case of cryptocurrency companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms banks or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it the underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by satoshi nakamoto within a proofofwork system such as bitcoin the safety integrity and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme in a proofofstake blockchain transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency sometimes grouped together in stake pools most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement blockchain the validity of each cryptocurrencys coins is provided by a blockchain a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data it is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way for use as a distributed ledger a blockchain is typically managed by a peertopeer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks once recorded the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks which requires collusion of the network majority blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain nodes a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network the node supports the cryptocurrencys network through either relaying transactions validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain in terms of relaying transactions each network computer node has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction and every other transaction is known node owners are either volunteers those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network timestamping cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party the first timestamping scheme invented was the proofofwork scheme the most widely used proofofwork schemes are based on sha256 and scrypt some other hashing algorithms that are used for proofofwork include cryptonote blake sha3 and x11 another method is called the proofofstake scheme proofofstake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency it is different from proofofwork systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions the scheme is largely dependent on the coin and there is currently no standard form of it some cryptocurrencies use a combined proofofwork and proofofstake scheme mining on a blockchain mining is the validation of transactions for this effort successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network the rate of generating hashes which validate any transaction has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha256 and scrypt this arms race for cheaperyetefficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 mining is measured by hash rate typically in ths a 2023 imf working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of co2 emissions by 2027 accounting for 07 percent of global emissions or 12 percent of the world total with more people entering the world of virtual currency generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance consequently the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities to mitigate the heat the equipment produces and the electricity required to run them popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity a cold climate and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations by july 2019 bitcoins electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts around 02 of the global total or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland some miners pool resources sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block a share is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proofofwork as of february 2018 the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining many chinese miners have since relocated to canada and texas one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices in june 2018 hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining according to a february 2018 report from fortune iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity in march 2018 the city of plattsburgh new york put an 18month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the character and direction of the city in 2021 kazakhstan became the secondbiggest cryptocurrency mining country producing 181 of the global exahash rate the country built a compound containing 50000 computers near ekibastuz gpu price rise an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards gpu in 2017 the computing power of gpus makes them wellsuited to generating hashes popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidias gtx 1060 and gtx 1070 graphics cards as well as amds rx 570 and rx 580 gpus doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock a gtx 1070 ti which was released at a price of 450 sold for as much as 1100 another popular card the gtx 1060 6 gb model was released at an msrp of 250 and sold for almost 500 rx 570 and rx 580 cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpus as soon as they are available nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners boris bhles pr manager for nvidia in the german region said gamers come first for nvidia mining accelerator chips numerous companies developed dedicated cryptomining accelerator chips capable of priceperformance far higher than that of cpu or gpu mining at one point intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip named blockscale wallets a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private keys address or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency with the private key it is possible to write in the public ledger effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency with the public key it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet these methods range from using paper wallets which are public private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are hardware to store your wallet information to a digital wallet which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext anonymity bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys or addresses thereby bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain still cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users some cryptocurrencies such as monero zerocoin zerocash and cryptonote implement additional measures to increase privacy such as by using zeroknowledge proofs a recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies the attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards in order to improve privacy researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the ip address of the source economics cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the internet block rewards proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offer block rewards incentives for miners there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances the rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency by making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate the public blockchain not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution generally the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs but this may not always be the case the current value not the longterm value of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities in 2018 bitcoins design caused a 14 welfare loss compared to an efficient cash system while a cash system with 2 money growth has a minor 0003 welfare cost the main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost which is estimated to be us360 million per year this translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230 before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment however the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether transaction fees transaction fees sometimes also referred to as miner fees or gas fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction the ability for the holder to be allowed to set the fee manually often depends on the wallet software used and central exchanges for cryptocurrency cex usually do not allow the customer to set a custom transaction fee for the transaction their wallet software such as coinbase wallet however might support adjusting the fee select cryptocurrency exchanges have offered to let the user choose between different presets of transaction fee values during the currency conversion one of those exchanges namely litebit previously headquartered in the netherlands was forced to cease all operations on august 13th 2023 due to market changes and regulatory pressure the recommended fee suggested by the network will often depend on the time of day due to depending on network load for ethereum transaction fees differ by computational complexity bandwidth use and storage needs while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses segwit in february 2023 the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to 22845 while for bitcoin it corresponded to 0659 some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees the most wellknown example being nano xno and instead rely on clientside proofofwork as the transaction prioritization and antispam mechanism exchanges cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets such as conventional fiat money or to trade between different digital currencies crypto marketplaces do not guarantee that an investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price as a result as of 2020 it was possible to arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets atomic swaps atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange atms jordan kelley founder of robocoin launched the first bitcoin atm in the united states on 20 february 2014 the kiosk installed in austin texas is similar to bank atms but has scanners to read governmentissued identification such as a drivers license or a passport to confirm users identities initial coin offerings an initial coin offering ico is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture an ico may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation however securities regulators in many jurisdictions including in the us and canada have indicated that if a coin or token is an investment contract eg under the howey test ie an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others it is a security and is subject to securities regulation in an ico campaign a percentage of the cryptocurrency usually in the form of tokens is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies often bitcoin or ether according to pricewaterhousecoopers four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used switzerland as a base where they are frequently registered as nonprofit foundations the swiss regulatory agency finma stated that it would take a balanced approach to ico projects and would allow legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system in response to numerous requests by industry representatives a legislative ico working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018 which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices price trends the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation the total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by bitcoin accounting for at least 50 of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to bitcoin bitcoins value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of bitcoin itself the cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the halving which is when the block rewards received from bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of bitcoin as the date reaches near of a halving twice thus far historically the cryptocurrency market cap increases followed by a downtrend by june 2021 cryptocurrency had begun to be offered by some wealth managers in the us for 401ks volatility cryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks for example over one week in may 2022 bitcoin lost 20 of its value and ethereum lost 26 while solana and cardano lost 41 and 35 respectively the falls were attributed to warnings about inflation by comparison in the same week the nasdaq tech stock index fell 76 per cent and the ftse 100 was 36 per cent down in the longer term of the 10 leading cryptocurrencies identified by the total value of coins in circulation in january 2018 only four bitcoin ethereum cardano and ripple xrp were still in that position in early 2022 the total value of all cryptocurrencies was 2 trillion at the end of 2021 but had halved nine months later the wall street journal has commented that the crypto sector has become intertwined with the rest of the capital markets and sensitive to the same forces that drive tech stocks and other risk assets such as inflation forecasts databases there are also centralized databases outside of blockchains that store crypto market data compared to the blockchain databases perform fast as there is no verification process four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are coinmarketcap coingecko bravenewcoin and cryptocompare social and political aspects according to alan feuer of the new york times libertarians and anarchocapitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin early bitcoin supporter roger ver said at first almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons we saw bitcoin as a great idea as a way to separate money from the state economist paul krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are something of a cult based in paranoid fantasies of government power david golumbia says that the ideas influencing bitcoin advocates emerge from rightwing extremist movements such as the liberty lobby and the john birch society and their anticentral bank rhetoric or more recently ron paul and tea partystyle libertarianism steve bannon who owns a good stake in bitcoin sees cryptocurrency as a form of disruptive populism taking control back from central authorities bitcoins founder satoshi nakamoto supported the idea that cryptocurrencies go well with libertarianism its very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly nakamoto said in 2008 according to the european central bank the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the austrian school of economics especially with friedrich von hayek in his book denationalisation of money the argument refined in which hayek advocates a complete free market in the production distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks increasing regulation the rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users the financial action task force fatf has defined cryptocurrencyrelated services as virtual asset service providers vasps and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering aml and know your customer kyc requirements as financial institutions in may 2020 the joint working group on intervasp messaging standards published ivms 101 a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between vasps the fatf and financial regulators were informed as the data model was developed in june 2020 fatf updated its guidance to include the travel rule for cryptocurrencies a measure which mandates that vasps obtain hold and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using json for relaying data between vasps and identity services as of december 2020 the ivms 101 data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it the european commission published a digital finance strategy in september 2020 this included a draft regulation on markets in cryptoassets mica which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the eu on 10 june 2021 the basel committee on banking supervision proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses for instance if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth 2 billion it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire 2 billion this is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets however this is a proposal and not a regulation the imf is seeking a coordinated consistent and comprehensive approach to supervising cryptocurrencies tobias adrian the imfs financial counsellor and head of its monetary and capital markets department said in a january 2022 interview that agreeing global regulations is never quick but if we start now we can achieve the goal of maintaining financial stability while also enjoying the benefits which the underlying technological innovations bring in may 2024 15 years after the advent of the first blockchain bitcoin the us congress advanced a bill to the full house of representatives to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets the financial innovation and technology for the 21st century act which defines responsibilities between various us agencies notably between the commodity futures trading commission cftc for decentralized blockchains and the securities and exchange commission sec for blockchains that are functional but not decentralized stablecoins are excluded from both cftc and sec regulation in this bill except for fraud and certain activities by registered firms china in september 2017 china banned icos to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window the liquidity changes by banning icos in china was temporarily negative while the liquidity effect became positive after news on 18 may 2021 china banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services this led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work cryptocurrencies for instance bitcoin fell 31 ethereum fell 44 binance coin fell 32 and dogecoin fell 30 proof of work mining was the next focus with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create bitcoin and ethereum in september 2021 the chinese government declared all cryptocurrency transactions of any kind illegal completing its crackdown on cryptocurrency cook islands in april 2024 tvnzs 1news reported that the cook islands government was proposing legislation that would allow recovery agents to use various means including hacking to investigate or find cryptocurrency that may have been used for illegal means or is the proceeds of crime the tainted cryptocurrency recovery bill was drafted by two lawyers hired by usbased debt collection company drumcliffe the proposed legislation was criticised by cook islands crown laws deputy solicitor general david greig who described it as flawed and said that some provisions were clearly unconstitutional the cook islands financial services development authority described drumcliffes involvement as a conflict of interest similar criticism was echoed by auckland university of technology cryptocurrency specialist and senior lecturer jeff nijsse and university of otago political scientist professor robert patman who described it as government overreach and described it as inconsistent with international law since the cook islands is an associated state that is part of the realm of new zealand patman said that the law would have implications for new zealands governance arrangements a spokesperson for new zealand foreign minister winston peters confirmed that new zealand officials were discussing the legislation with their cook islands counterparts cook islands prime minister mark brown defended the legislation as part of the territorys fight against international cybercrime el salvador on 9 june 2021 el salvador announced that it will adopt bitcoin as legal tender becoming the first country to do so india at present india neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market in 2020 the supreme court of india had lifted the ban on cryptocurrency which was imposed by the reserve bank of india since then an investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime but it is being contemplated that the indian parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in india expressing his public policy opinion on the indian cryptocurrency market to a wellknown online publication a leading public policy lawyer and vice president of saarclaw south asian association for regional cooperation in law hemant batra has said that the cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment he mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it he favoured following imf and fatf guidelines in this regard south africa south africa which has seen a large number of scams related to cryptocurrency is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place that will produce a regulatory framework the largest scam occurred in april 2021 where the two founders of an africanbased cryptocurrency exchange called africrypt raees cajee and ameer cajee disappeared with 38 billion worth of bitcoin additionally mirror trading international disappeared with 170 million worth of cryptocurrency in january 2021 south korea in march 2021 south korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets this legislation requires all digital asset managers providers and exchanges to be registered with the korea financial intelligence unit in order to operate in south korea registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the information security management system and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts it also requires that the ceo and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks switzerland switzerland was one of the first countries to implement the fatfs travel rule finma the swiss regulator issued its own guidance to vasps in 2019 the guidance followed the fatfs recommendation 16 however with stricter requirements according to finmas requirements vasps need to verify the identity of the beneficiary of the transfer turkey on 30 april 2021 the central bank of the republic of turkey banned the use of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets for making purchases on the grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks united kingdom in the united kingdom as of 10 january 2021 all cryptocurrency firms such as exchanges advisors and professionals that have either a presence market product or provide services within the uk market must register with the financial conduct authority additionally on 27 june 2021 the financial watchdog demanded that binance the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange cease all regulated activities in the uk united states in 2021 17 states in the us passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation this led the securities and exchange commission to start considering what steps to take on 8 july 2021 senator elizabeth warren part of the senate banking committee wrote to the chairman of the sec and demanded answers on cryptocurrency regulation due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this posed to consumers on 5 august 2021 the chairman gary gensler responded to warrens letter and called for legislation focused on crypto trading lending and defi platforms because of how vulnerable investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker he also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight additionally gensler did not hold back in his criticism of stablecoins these tokens which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems such as antimoney laundering tax compliance and sanctions on 19 october 2021 the first bitcoinlinked exchangetraded fund etf from proshares started trading on the nyse under the ticker bito proshares ceo michael l sapir said the etf would expose bitcoin to a wider range of investors without the hassle of setting up accounts with cryptocurrency providers ian balina the ceo of token metrics stated that sec approval of the etf was a significant endorsement for the crypto industry because many regulators globally were not in favor of crypto and retail investors were hesitant to accept crypto this event would eventually open more opportunities for new capital and new people in this space the department of the treasury on 20 may 2021 announced that it would require any transfer worth 10000 or more to be reported to the internal revenue service since cryptocurrency already posed a problem where illegal activity like tax evasion was facilitated broadly this release from the irs was a part of efforts to promote better compliance and consider more severe penalties for tax evaders on 17 february 2022 the department of justice named eun young choi as the first director of a national cryptocurrency enforcement team to help identify and deal with misuse of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets the biden administration faced a dilemma as it tried to develop regulations for the cryptocurrency industry on one hand officials were hesitant to restrict a growing industry on the other hand they were committed to preventing illegal cryptocurrency transactions to reconcile these conflicting goals on 9 march 2022 biden issued an executive order followed this on 16 september 2022 the comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets document was released to support development of cryptocurrencies and restrict their illegal use the executive order included all digital assets but cryptocurrencies posed both the greatest security risks and potential economic benefits though this might not address all of the challenges in crypto industry it was a significant milestone in the us cryptocurrency regulation history in february 2023 the sec ruled that cryptocurrency exchange krakens estimated 42 billion in staked assets globally operated as an illegal securities seller the company agreed to a 30 million settlement with the sec and to cease selling its staking service in the us the case would impact other major crypto exchanges operating staking programs on 23 march 2023 the sec issued an alert to investors stating that firms offering crypto asset securities might not be complying with us laws the sec argued that unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities might not include important information legality the legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them at least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool while some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade others have banned or restricted it according to the library of congress in 2021 an absolute ban on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in 9 countries algeria bangladesh bolivia china egypt iraq morocco nepal and the united arab emirates an implicit ban applies in another 39 countries or regions which include bahrain benin burkina faso burundi cameroon chad cote divoire the dominican republic ecuador gabon georgia guyana indonesia iran jordan kazakhstan kuwait lebanon lesotho macau maldives mali moldova namibia niger nigeria oman pakistan palau republic of congo saudi arabia sengeal tajikistan tanzania togo turkey turkmenistan qatar and vietnam in the united states and canada state and provincial securities regulators coordinated through the north american securities administrators association are investigating bitcoin scams and icos in 40 jurisdictions various government agencies departments and courts have classified bitcoin differently china central bank banned the handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in china in early 2014 in russia though owning cryptocurrency is legal its residents are only allowed to purchase goods from other residents using the russian ruble while nonresidents are allowed to use foreign currency regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems in august 2018 the bank of thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency the central bank digital currency cbdc advertising bans cryptocurrency advertisements have been banned on the following platforms google ended august 2021 twitter facebook ended december 2021 bing ended june 2022 snapchat linkedin mailchimp baidu tencent weibo line yandex us tax status on 25 march 2014 the united states internal revenue service irs ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes therefore virtual currencies are considered commodities subject to capital gains tax legal concerns relating to an unregulated global economy as the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009 so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers however with banktobank wire transfers for instance the account holder must at least provide a proven identity transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions cryptocurrency makes legal enforcement against extremist groups more complicated which consequently strengthens them white supremacist richard spencer went as far as to declare bitcoin the currency of the altright loss theft and fraud in february 2014 the worlds largest bitcoin exchange mt gox declared bankruptcy likely due to theft the company claimed that it had lost nearly 750000 bitcoins belonging to their clients this added up to approximately 7 of all bitcoins in existence worth a total of 473 million mt gox blamed hackers who had exploited the transaction malleability problems in the network the price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about 1160 in december to under 400 in february on 21 november 2017 tether announced that it had been hacked losing 31 million in usdt from its core treasury wallet on 7 december 2017 slovenian cryptocurrency exchange nicehash reported

customers were still granted access to 75 of their assets in may 2018 bitcoin gold had its transactions hijacked and abused by unknown hackers exchanges lost an estimated 18m and bitcoin gold was delisted from bittrex after it refused to pay its share of the damages on 13 september 2018 homero josh garza was sentenced to 21 months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release garza had founded the cryptocurrency startups gaw miners and zenminer in 2014 acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015 the sec separately brought a civil enforcement action in the us against garza who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of 91 million plus 700000 in interest the secs complaint stated that garza through his companies had fraudulently sold investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated from mining in january 2018 japanese exchange coincheck reported that hackers had stolen cryptocurrency worth 530 million in june 2018 south korean exchange coinrail was hacked losing over 37 million in crypto the hack worsened a cryptocurrency selloff by an additional 42 billion on 9 july 2018 the exchange bancor whose code and fundraising had been subjects of controversy had 235 million in crypto stolen a 2020 eu report found that users had lost cryptoassets worth hundreds of millions of us dollars in security breaches at exchanges and storage providers between 2011 and 2019 reported breaches ranged from four to twelve a year in 2019 more than a billion dollars worth of cryptoassets was reported stolen stolen assets typically find their way to illegal markets and are used to fund further criminal activity according to a 2020 report produced by the united states attorney generals cyberdigital task force hree categories make up the majority of illicit cryptocurrency uses 1 financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes 2 money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax reporting or other legal requirements or 3 crimes such as theft directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself the report concluded that for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential it is imperative that these risks be addressed and that the government has legal and regulatory tools available at its disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrencys illicit uses according to the uk 2020 national risk assessmenta comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risk in the ukthe risk of using cryptoassets such as bitcoin for money laundering and terrorism financing is assessed as medium from low in the previous 2017 report legal scholars suggested that the money laundering opportunities may be more perceived than real blockchain analysis company chainalysis concluded that illicit activities like cybercrime money laundering and terrorism financing made up only 015 of all crypto transactions conducted in 2021 representing a total of 14 billion in december 2021 monkey kingdom a nft project based in hong kong lost us13 million worth of cryptocurrencies via a phishing link used by the hacker on november 2 2023 sam bankmanfried was pronounced guilty on seven counts of fraud related to ftx federal criminal court sentencing experts speculated on the potential amount of prison time likely to be meted out on march 28 2024 the court sentenced bankmanfried to 25 years in prison money laundering according to blockchain data company chainalysis criminals laundered us8600000000 worth of cryptocurrency in 2021 up by 30 from the previous year the data suggests that rather than managing numerous illicit havens cybercriminals make use of a small group of purpose built centralized exchanges for sending and receiving illicit cryptocurrency in 2021 those exchanges received 47 of funds sent by crime linked addresses almost 22bn worth of cryptocurrencies was embezzled from defi protocols in 2021 which represents 72 of all cryptocurrency theft in 2021 according to bloomberg and the new york times federation tower a two skyscraper complex in the heart of moscow city is home to many cryptocurrency businesses under suspicion of facilitating extensive money laundering including accepting illicit cryptocurrency funds obtained through scams darknet markets and ransomware notable businesses include garantex eggchange cashbank buybitcoin tetchange bitzlato and suex which was sanctioned by the us in 2021 bitzlato founder and owner anatoly legkodymov was arrested following moneylaundering charges by the united states department of justice dark money has also been flowing into russia through a dark web marketplace called hydra which is powered by cryptocurrency and enjoyed more than 1 billion in sales in 2020 according to chainalysis the platform demands that sellers liquidate cryptocurrency only through certain regional exchanges which has made it difficult for investigators to trace the money almost 74 of ransomware revenue in 2021 over 400 million worth of cryptocurrency went to software strains likely affiliated with russia where oversight is notoriously limited however russians are also leaders in the benign adoption of cryptocurrencies as the ruble is unreliable and president putin favours the idea of overcoming the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies in 2022 renbridge an unregulated alternative to exchanges for transferring value between blockchains was found to be responsible for the laundering of at least 540 million since 2020 it is especially popular with people attempting to launder money from theft this includes a cyberattack on japanese crypto exchange liquid that has been linked to north korea darknet markets properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets such as silk road the original silk road was shut down in october 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then in the year following the initial shutdown of silk road the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve while the amount of drug listings increased from 18000 to 32000 darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world in the us bitcoins are regarded as virtual assets this type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets wash trades various studies have found that cryptotrading is rife with wash trading wash trading is a process illegal in some jurisdictions involving buyers and sellers being the same person or group and may be used to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency or inflate volume artificially exchanges with higher volumes can demand higher premiums from token issuers a study from 2019 concluded that up to 80 of trades on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be wash trades a 2019 report by bitwise asset management claimed that 95 of all bitcoin trading volume reported on major website coinmarketcap had been artificially generated and of 81 exchanges studied only 10 provided legitimate volume figures as a tool to evade sanctions in 2022 cryptocurrencies attracted attention when western nations imposed severe economic sanctions on russia in the aftermath of its invasion of ukraine in february however american sources warned in march that some cryptotransactions could potentially be used to evade economic sanctions against russia and belarus in april 2022 the computer programmer virgil griffith received a fiveyear prison sentence in the us for attending a pyongyang cryptocurrency conference where he gave a presentation on blockchains which might be used for sanctions evasion impacts and analysis the bank for international settlements summarized several criticisms of cryptocurrencies in chapter v of their 2018 annual report the criticisms include the lack of stability in their price the high energy consumption high and variable transactions costs the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges vulnerability to debasement from forking and the influence of miners speculation fraud and adoption cryptocurrencies have been compared to ponzi schemes pyramid schemes and economic bubbles such as housing market bubbles howard marks of oaktree capital management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were nothing but an unfounded fad or perhaps even a pyramid scheme based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it and compared them to the tulip mania 1637 south sea bubble 1720 and dotcom bubble 1999 which all experienced profound price booms and busts regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken measures to dissuade users however research in 2021 by the uks financial regulator suggests such warnings either went unheard or were ignored fewer than one in 10 potential cryptocurrency buyers were aware of consumer warnings on the fca website and 12 of crypto users were not aware that their holdings were not protected by statutory compensation of 1000 respondents between the ages of eighteen and forty almost 70 wrongly assumed cryptocurrencies were regulated 75 of younger crypto investors claimed to be driven by competition with friends and family 58 said that social media enticed them to make high risk investments the fca recommends making use of its warning list which flags unauthorized financial firms many banks do not offer virtual currency services themselves and can refuse to do business with virtual currency companies in 2014 gareth murphy a senior banking officer suggested that the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies may lead to too much money being obfuscated blinding economists who would use such information to better steer the economy while traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place there is no intermediary with the power to limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen one of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards for example is consumer protection against fraud such as chargebacks the french regulator autorit des marchs financiers amf lists 16 websites of companies that solicit investment in cryptocurrency without being authorized to do so in france an october 2021 paper by the national bureau of economic research found that bitcoin suffers from systemic risk as the top 10000 addresses control about onethird of all bitcoin in circulation it is even worse for miners with 001 controlling 50 of the capacity according to researcher flipside crypto less than 2 of anonymous accounts control 95 of all available bitcoin supply this is considered risky as a great deal of the market is in the hands of a few entities a paper by john griffin a finance professor at the university of texas and amin shams a graduate student found that in 2017 the price of bitcoin had been substantially inflated using another cryptocurrency tether roger lowenstein author of bank of america the epic struggle to create the federal reserve says in a new york times story that ftx will face over 8 billion in claims nonfungible tokens nonfungible tokens nfts are digital assets that represent art collectibles gaming etc like crypto their data is stored on the blockchain nfts are bought and traded using cryptocurrency the ethereum blockchain was the first place where nfts were implemented but now many other blockchains have created their own versions of nfts banks according to vanessa grellet renowned panelist in blockchain conferences there was an increasing interest from traditional stock exchanges in cryptoassets at the end of the 2010s while cryptoexchanges such as coinbase were gradually entering the traditional financial markets this convergence marked a significant trend where conventional financial actors were adopting blockchain technology to enhance operational efficiency while the crypto world introduced innovations like security token offering sto enabling new ways of fundraising tokenization turning assets such as real estate investment funds and private equity into blockchainbased tokens had the potential to make traditionally illiquid assets more accessible to investors despite the regulatory risks associated with such developments major financial institutions including jpmorgan chase were actively working on blockchain initiatives exemplified by the creation of quorum a private blockchain platform as the first big wall street bank to embrace cryptocurrencies morgan stanley announced on 17 march 2021 that they will be offering access to bitcoin funds for their wealthy clients through three funds which enable bitcoin ownership for investors with an aggressive risk tolerance bny mellon on 11 february 2021 announced that it would begin offering cryptocurrency services to its clients on 20 april 2021 venmo added support to its platform to enable customers to buy hold and sell cryptocurrencies in october 2021 financial services company mastercard announced it is working with digital asset manager bakkt on a platform that would allow any bank or merchant on the mastercard network to offer cryptocurrency services environmental effects mining for proofofwork cryptocurrencies requires enormous amounts of electricity and consequently comes with a large carbon footprint due to causing greenhouse gas emissions proofofwork blockchains such as bitcoin ethereum litecoin and monero were estimated to have added between 3 million and 15 million tons of carbon dioxide co2 to the atmosphere in the period from 1 january 2016 to 30 june 2017 by november 2018 bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 458twh generating 220 to 229 million tons of co2 rivalling nations like jordan and sri lanka by the end of 2021 bitcoin was estimated to produce 654 million tons of co2 as much as greece and consume between 91 and 177 terawatthours annually critics have also identified a large electronic waste problem in disposing of mining rigs mining hardware is improving at a fast rate quickly resulting in older generations of hardware bitcoin is the least energyefficient cryptocurrency using 7076 kilowatthours of electricity per transaction before june 2021 china was the primary location for bitcoin mining however due to concerns over power usage and other factors china forced out bitcoin operations at least temporarily as a result the united states promptly emerged as the top global leader in the industry an example of a gross amount of electronic waste associated with bitcoin mining operations in the us is a facility that located in dalton georgia which is consuming nearly the same amount of electricity as the combined power usage of 97000 households in its vicinity another example is that riot platforms operates a bitcoin mining facility in rockdale texas which consumes approximately as much electricity as the nearby 300000 households this makes it the most energyintensive bitcoin mining operation in the united states the worlds secondlargest cryptocurrency ethereum uses 6256 kilowatthours of electricity per transaction xrp is the worlds most energy efficient cryptocurrency using 00079 kilowatthours of electricity per transaction although the biggest pow blockchains consume energy on the scale of mediumsized countries the annual power demand from proofofstake pos blockchains is on a scale equivalent to a housing estate the times identified six environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies chia iota cardano nano solarcoin and bitgreen academics and researchers have used various methods for estimating the energy use and energy efficiency of blockchains a study of the six largest proofofstake networks in may 2021 concluded cardano has the lowest electricity use per node polkadot has the lowest electricity use overall and solana has the lowest electricity use per transaction in terms of annual consumption kwhyr the figures were polkadot 70237 tezos 113249 avalanche 489311 algorand 512671 cardano 598755 and solana 1967930 this equates to polkadot consuming 7 times the electricity of an average us home cardano 57 homes and solana 200 times as much the research concluded that pos networks consumed 0001 the electricity of the bitcoin network university college london researchers reached a similar conclusion variable renewable energy power stations could invest in bitcoin mining to reduce curtailment hedge electricity price risk stabilize the grid increase the profitability of renewable energy power stations and therefore accelerate transition to sustainable energy technological limitations there are also purely technical elements to consider for example technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high upfront costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction additionally cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware data loss or the destruction of the physical media this precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent resulting in its effective removal from the markets academic studies in september 2015 the establishment of the peerreviewed academic journal ledger issn 23795980 was announced it covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies and is published by the university of pittsburgh the journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers aid agencies a number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies including unicef christopher fabian principal adviser at unicef innovation said the childrens fund would uphold donor protocols meaning that people making donations online would have to pass checks before they were allowed to deposit funds however in 2021 there was a backlash against donations in bitcoin because of the environmental emissions it caused some agencies stopped accepting bitcoin and others turned to greener cryptocurrencies the us arm of greenpeace stopped accepting bitcoin donations after seven years it said as the amount of energy needed to run bitcoin became clearer this policy became no longer tenable in 2022 the ukrainian government raised over us10000000 worth of aid through cryptocurrency following the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine criticism bitcoin has been characterized as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences paul krugman robert j shiller joseph stiglitz richard thaler james heckman thomas sargent angus deaton and oliver hart and by central bank officials including alan greenspan agustn carstens vtor constncio and nout wellink investors warren buffett and george soros have respectively characterized it as a mirage and a bubble while business executives jack ma and jp morgan chase ceo jamie dimon have called it a bubble and a fraud respectively although jamie dimon later said he regretted dubbing bitcoin a fraud blackrock ceo laurence d fink called bitcoin an index of money laundering in june 2022 business magnate bill gates said that cryptocurrencies are 100 based on greater fool theory legal scholars criticize the lack of regulation which hinders conflict resolution when crypto assets are at the center of a legal dispute for example a divorce or an inheritance in switzerland jurists generally deny that cryptocurrencies are objects that fall under property law as cryptocurrencies do not belong to any class of legally defined objects typenzwang the legal numerus clausus therefore it is debated whether anybody could even be sued for embezzlement of cryptocurrency if heshe had access to someones wallet however in the law of obligations and contract law any kind of object would be legally valid but the object would have to be tied to an identified counterparty however as the more popular cryptocurrencies can be freely and quickly exchanged into legal tender they are financial assets and have to be taxed and accounted for as such in 2018 an increase in cryptorelated suicides was noticed after the cryptocurrency market crashed in august the situation was particularly critical in korea as crypto traders were on suicide watch a cryptocurrency forum on reddit even started providing suicide prevention support to affected investors the may 2022 collapse of the luna currency operated by terra also led to reports of suicidal investors in cryptorelated subreddits see also
