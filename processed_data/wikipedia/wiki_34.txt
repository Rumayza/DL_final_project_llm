distance between friends and loved ones social impacts media critic siva vaidhyanathan refers to social media as antisocial media in reference to its negative impacts including on loneliness and political polarization audrey tang also uses the term antisocial in reference to its impact on democracy disparity political polarization many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them jonathan haidt compared the impact of social media to the tower of babel and the chaos it unleashed as a result aviv ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content but could be designed to reduce polarization instead in 2017 facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity misinformation and lowquality news some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts some advocate for media literacy as a solution others argue that less social media or more local journalism could help address political polarization stereotyping a 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations for example during the covid19 pandemic youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on

youth communicate by introducing new forms of language novel acronyms save time as illustrated by lol which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud the hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion for some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media the american academy of pediatrics reported that bullying the making of noninclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk however adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities regulation by government authorities situation by geographical region australia in july 2014 in response to wikileaks release of a secret suppression order made by the

2014 thai coup dtat the public was explicitly instructed not to share or like dissenting views on social media or face prison united states historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented they set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore the us enacted the communications decency act in 1996 section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 47 usc 230c1in 2024 legislation was enacted in florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14 and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval european union the european union initially took a similar approach however in 2020 the european commission presented two legislative proposals the digital services act dsa and the digital markets act dma both proposals were enacted in july 2022 the dsa entered into force on 17 february 2024 the dma in march 2024 this legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by meps what is illegal offline must also be illegal online very large online platforms must therefore among other things delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the european commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising violators could face a complete ban in europe or fines of up to 6 of global sales such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance the dsa allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction according to patrick breyer from the german pirate party a problem could arise from the hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of victor orban as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied euwide discussions and proposals 2018 nobel laureate paul romer advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms similar to a carbon tax negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them however consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax another proposal is to invoke competition law the idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law this would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines in a 2024 opinion piece megan moreno and jenny radesky professors of pediatrics wrote about the need for nuanced policy they regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful they commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages in june 2024 us surgeon general vivek murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people business models the business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them this strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see platforms such as x add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues criticism debate and controversy the enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability impact on concentration mental health content ownership and the meaning of interactions
