sustainable development is an approach to growth and human development that aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs the aim is to have a society where living conditions and resources meet human needs without undermining planetary integrity sustainable development aims to balance the needs of the economy environment and social wellbeing the brundtland report in 1987 helped to make the concept of sustainable development better known sustainable development overlaps with the idea of sustainability which is a normative concept unesco formulated a distinction between the two concepts as follows sustainability is often thought of as a longterm goal ie a more sustainable world while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it the rio process that began at the 1992 earth summit in rio de janeiro has placed the concept of sustainable development on the international agenda sustainable development is the foundational concept of the sustainable development goals sdgs these global goals for the year 2030 were adopted in 2015 by the united nations general assembly unga they address the global challenges including for example poverty climate change biodiversity loss and peace there are some problems with the concept of sustainable development some scholars say it is an oxymoron because according to them development is inherently unsustainable other commentators are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far scholars have stated that sustainable development is openended much critiqued as ambiguous incoherent and therefore easily appropriated definition of sustainable development in 1987 the united nations world commission on environment and development released the report our common future commonly called the brundtland report the report included a definition of sustainable development which is now widely used sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs it contains two key concepts within it the concept of needs in particular the essential needs of the worlds poor to which overriding priority should be given and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environments ability to meet present and future needssustainable development thus tries to find a balance between economic development environmental protection and social wellbeing however scholars have pointed out that there are manifold understandings of sustainable development also there are incoherencies in the dominant marketbased socioeconomicpolitical organisation attempts towards universal sustainable development need to account for the extremely varied challenges circumstances and choices that shape prospects and prosperity for all everywhere related concepts sustainability development of the concept sustainable development has its roots in ideas regarding sustainable forest management which were developed in europe during the 17th and 18th centuries in response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in england john evelyn argued in his 1662 essay sylva that sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner in order to stop the destructive over exploitation of natural resources in 1713 hans carl von carlowitz a senior mining administrator in the service of elector frederick augustus i of saxony published sylvicultura economics a 400page work on forestry building upon the ideas of evelyn and french minister jeanbaptiste colbert von carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield his work influenced others including alexander von humboldt and georg ludwig hartig eventually leading to the development of the science of forestry this in turn influenced people like gifford pinchot the first head of the us forest service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and aldo leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s following the publication of rachel carsons silent spring in 1962 the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation kenneth e boulding in his influential 1966 essay the economics of the coming spaceship earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources another milestone was the 1968 article by garrett hardin that popularized the term tragedy of the commons the direct linking of sustainability and development in a contemporary sense can be traced to the early 1970s strategy of progress a 1972 book in german by ernst basler explained how the longacknowledged sustainability concept of preserving forests for future wood production can be directly transferred to the broader importance of preserving environmental resources to sustain the world for future generations that same year the interrelationship of environment and development was formally demonstrated in a systems dynamic simulation model reported in the classic report on limits to growth this was commissioned by the club of rome and written by a group of scientists led by dennis and donella meadows of the massachusetts institute of technology describing the desirable state of global equilibrium the authors wrote we are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people the year 1972 also saw the publication of the influential book a blueprint for survival in 1975 an mit research group prepared ten days of hearings on growth and its implication for the future for the us congress the first hearings ever held on sustainable development in 1980 the international union for conservation of nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term sustainable development 4 two years later the united nations world charter for nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged since the brundtland report the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth 5 in 1992 the un conference on environment and development published the earth charter which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the 21st century the action plan agenda 21 for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognizes these interdependent pillars furthermore agenda 21 emphasizes that broad public participation in decisionmaking is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development the rio protocol was a huge leap forward for the first time the world agreed on a sustainability agenda in fact a global consensus was facilitated by neglecting concrete goals and operational details global governance framework the most comprehensive global governance framework for sustainable development is the 2030 agenda for sustainable development with its 17 sustainable development goals sdgs this agenda was a followup to the millennium declaration from the year 2000 with its eight millennium development goals mdgs the first comprehensive global governance framework for the achievement of sustainable development the sdgs have concrete targets unlike the results from the rio process but no methods for sanctions 137 they contain goals targets and indicators for example in the areas of poverty reduction environmental protection human prosperity and peace dimensions sustainable development like sustainability is regarded to have three dimensions the environment economy and society the idea is that a good balance between the three dimensions should be achieved instead of calling them dimensions other terms commonly used are pillars domains aspects spheres pathways six interdependent capacities are deemed to be necessary for the successful pursuit of sustainable development these are the capacities to measure progress towards sustainable development promote equity within and between generations adapt to shocks and surprises transform the system onto more sustainable development pathways link knowledge with action for sustainability and to devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together during the mdg era year 2000 to 2015 the key objective of sustainable development was poverty reduction to be reached through economic growth and participation in the global trade system the sdgs take a much more comprehensive approach to sustainable development than the mdgs did they offer a more peoplecentred development agenda out of the 17 sdgs for example 11 goals contain targets related to equity equality or inclusion and sdg 10 is solely devoted to addressing inequality within and among countries environmental sustainability environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive since natural resources are derived from the environment the state of air water and climate is of particular concern environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet this for example entails using water sustainably using renewable energy and sustainable material supplies eg harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity an unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital the total of natures resources is used up faster than it can be replenished 58 sustainability requires that human activity only uses natures resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity theoretically the longterm result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life important operational principles of sustainable development were published by herman daly in 1990 renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for nonrenewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment land use changes agriculture and food environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through approaches such as sustainable agriculture organic farming and more sustainable business practices the most costeffective climate change mitigation options include afforestation sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation at the local level there are various movements working towards sustainable food systems which may include less meat consumption local food production slow food sustainable gardening and organic gardening the environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production materials and waste as global population and affluence have increased so has the use of various materials increased in volume diversity and distance transported included here are raw materials minerals synthetic chemicals including hazardous substances manufactured products food living organisms and waste by 2050 humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current amount unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption developed countries citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per year ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable by comparison the average person in india today consumes four tons per year sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of dematerialization converting the linear path of materials extraction use disposal in landfill to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature dematerialization is being encouraged through the ideas of industrial ecology eco design and ecolabelling this way of thinking is expressed in the concept of circular economy which employs reuse sharing repair refurbishment remanufacturing and recycling to create a closedloop system minimizing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste pollution and carbon emissions building electric vehicles has been one of the most popular ways in the field of sustainable development the potential of using reusable energy and reducing waste offered a perspective in sustainable development the european commission has adopted an ambitious circular economy action plan in 2020 which aims at making sustainable products the norm in the eu biodiversity and ecosystem services there is a connection between ecosystems and biodiversity ecosystems are made up of various living things interacting with one another and their surroundings along with this biodiversity lays the groundwork for ecosystems to function well by defining the kinds of species that can coexist in an environment as well as their functions and interactions with other species in 2019 a summary for policymakers of the largest most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services was published by the intergovernmental sciencepolicy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services it recommended that human civilization will need a transformative change including sustainable agriculture reductions in consumption and waste fishing quotas and collaborative water management biodiversity is not only crucial for the wellbeing of animals and wildlife but also plays a positive role in the lives of human beings in the way in which it aids development of human life management of human consumption and impacts the environmental impact of a community or humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used whether or not those resources are renewable and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved careful resource management can be applied at many scales from economic sectors like agriculture manufacturing and industry to work organizations the consumption patterns of households and individuals and the resource demands of individual goods and services the underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption this impact is reduced by not only consuming less but also making the full cycle of production use and disposal more sustainable consumption of goods and services can be analyzed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy key resource categories relating to human needs are food energy raw materials and water improving on economic and social aspects it has been suggested that because of the rural poverty and overexploitation environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets called natural capital economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product this model of unlimited personal and gdp growth may be over sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption growth generally ignores the direct effect that the environment may have on social welfare whereas development takes it into account as early as the 1970s the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems scientists in many fields have highlighted the limits to growth and economists have presented alternatives for example a steadystate economy to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet in 1987 the economist edward barbier published the study the concept of sustainable economic development where he recognized that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other a world bank study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings defined as traditional net savings less the value of resource depletion and environmental degradation plus the value of investment in human capital policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability in macroeconomics or purely environmental several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare eventually reaching a goldenrule steady state a meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of concrete understanding of what sustainability policies might entail in practice a study concluded in 2007 that knowledge manufactured and human capital health and education has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world it has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics the world business council for sustainable development published a vision 2050 document in 2021 to show how business can lead the transformations the world needs the vision states that we envision a world in which 9billion people can live well within planetary boundaries by 2050 this report was highlighted by the guardian as the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date include reversing the damage done to ecosystems addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture barriers assessments and reactions the concept of sustainable development has been and still is subject to criticism including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development it has been argued that there is no such thing as sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earths finite stock 13 this perspective renders the industrial revolution as a whole unsustainable 20f 6167 22f the sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be nonsubstitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital while it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources it is much less likely that they will ever be able to replace ecosystem services such as the protection provided by the ozone layer or the climate stabilizing function of the amazonian forest the concept of sustainable development has been criticized from different angles while some see it as paradoxical or an oxymoron and regard development as inherently unsustainable others are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far part of the problem is that development itself is not consistently defined 16 the vagueness of the brundtland definition of sustainable development has been criticized as follows 17 the definition has opened up the possibility of downplaying sustainability hence governments spread the message that we can have it all at the same time ie economic growth prospering societies and a healthy environment no new ethic is required this socalled weak version of sustainability is popular among governments and businesses but profoundly wrong and not even weak as there is no alternative to preserving the earths ecological integrity 2 scholars have stated that sustainable development is openended much critiqued as ambiguous incoherent and therefore easily appropriated society and culture sustainable development goals sustainable development is the foundational concept of the sustainable development goals sdgs policies to achieve the sdgs are meant to cohere around this concept education for sustainable development education for sustainable development esd is a term officially used by the united nations it is defined as education practices that encourage changes in knowledge skills values and attitudes to enable a more sustainable and just society for humanity esd aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to sustainable developments economic social and environmental dimensions agenda 21 was the first international document that identified education as an essential tool for achieving sustainable development and highlighted areas of action for education esd is a component of measurement in an indicator for sustainable development goal 12 sdg for responsible consumption and production sdg 12 has 11 targets and target 128 is by 2030 ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature 20 years after the agenda 21 document was declared the future we want document was proclaimed in the rio20 un conference on sustainable development stating that we resolve to promote education for sustainable development and to integrate sustainable development more actively into education beyond the decade of education for sustainable development one version of education for sustainable development recognizes modernday environmental challenges it seeks to define new ways to adjust to a changing biosphere as well as engage individuals to address societal issues that come with them in the international encyclopedia of education this approach to education is seen as an attempt to shift consciousness toward an ethics of lifegiving relationships that respects the interconnectedness of man to his natural world to equip future members of society with environmental awareness and a sense of responsibility to sustainability for unesco education for sustainable development involves integrating key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning this may include for example instruction about climate change disaster risk reduction biodiversity and poverty reduction and sustainable consumption it also requires participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviours and take action for sustainable development esd consequently promotes competencies like critical thinking imagining future scenarios and making decisions in a collaborative way the thessaloniki declaration presented at the international conference on environment and society education and public awareness for sustainability by unesco and the government of greece december 1997 highlights the importance of sustainability not only with regards to the natural environment but also with poverty health food security democracy human rights and peace see also list of sustainability topics outline of sustainability overview of and topical guide to
