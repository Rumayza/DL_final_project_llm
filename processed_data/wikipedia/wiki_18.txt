cloud computing is a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with selfservice provisioning and administration ondemand according to iso essential characteristics in 2011 the national institute of standards and technology nist identified five essential characteristics for cloud systems below are the exact definitions according to nist ondemand selfservice a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider broad network access capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms eg mobile phones tablets laptops and workstations resource pooling the providers computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multitenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand rapid elasticity capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released in some cases automatically to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand to the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service eg storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service by 2023 the international organization for standardization iso had expanded and refined the list history the history of cloud computing extends back to the 1960s with the initial concepts of timesharing becoming popularized via remote job entry rje the data center model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes was predominantly used during this era this was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make largescale computing power available to more users through timesharing optimizing the infrastructure platform and applications and increasing efficiency for end users the cloud metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994 when it was used by general magic for the universe of places that mobile agents in the telescript environment could go the metaphor is credited to david hoffman a general magic communications specialist based on its longstanding use in networking and telecom the expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when compaq computer corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the internet the companys ambition was to supercharge sales with cloud computingenabled applications the business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful as a result compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers in the 2000s the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of amazon web services aws in 2002 which allowed developers to build applications independently in 2006 amazon simple storage service known as amazon s3 and the amazon elastic compute cloud ec2 were released in 2008 nasas development of the first opensource software for deploying private and hybrid clouds the following decade saw the launch of various cloud services in 2010 microsoft launched microsoft azure and rackspace hosting and nasa initiated an opensource cloudsoftware project openstack ibm introduced the ibm smartcloud framework in 2011 and oracle announced the oracle cloud in 2012 in december 2019 amazon launched aws outposts a service that extends aws infrastructure services apis and tools to customer data centers colocation spaces or onpremises facilities value proposition advocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize upfront it infrastructure costs proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster with improved manageability and less maintenance and that it enables it teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand providing burst computing capability high computing power at certain periods of peak demand additional value propositions of cloud computing include challenges and limitations one of the main challenges of cloud computing in comparison to more traditional onpremises computing is data security and privacy cloud users entrust their sensitive data to thirdparty providers who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access breaches or leaks cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection such as gdpr or hipaa another challenge of cloud computing is reduced visibility and control cloud users may not have full insight into how their cloud resources are managed configured or optimized by their providers they may also have limited ability to customize or modify their cloud services according to their specific needs or preferences complete understanding of all technology may be impossible especially given the scale complexity and deliberate opacity of contemporary systems however there is a need for understanding complex technologies and their interconnections to have power and agency within them the metaphor of the cloud can be seen as problematic as cloud computing retains the aura of something noumenal and numinous it is something experienced without precisely understanding what it is or how it works additionally cloud migration is a significant challenge this process involves transferring data applications or workloads from one cloud environment to another or from onpremises infrastructure to the cloud cloud migration can be complicated timeconsuming and expensive particularly when there are compatibility issues between different cloud platforms or architectures if not carefully planned and executed cloud migration can lead to downtime reduced performance or even data loss implementation challenges applications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment cloud cost overruns in a report by gartner a survey of 200 it leaders revealed that 69 experienced budget overruns in their organizations cloud expenditures during 2023 conversely 31 of it leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting proactive monitoring of spending and effective optimization service level agreements typically cloud providers service level agreements slas do not encompass all forms of service interruptions exclusions typically include planned maintenance downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues human errors like misconfigurations natural disasters force majeure events or security breaches typically customers bear the responsibility of monitoring sla compliance and must file claims for any unmet slas within a designated timeframe customers should be aware of how deviations from slas are calculated as these parameters may vary by service these requirements can place a considerable burden on customers additionally sla percentages and conditions can differ across various services within the same provider with some services lacking any sla altogether in cases of service interruptions due to hardware failures in the cloud provider the company typically does not offer monetary compensation instead eligible users may receive credits as outlined in the corresponding sla security and privacy cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time it could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant that is permitted in their privacy policies which users must agree to before they start using cloud services solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as endusers choices for how data is stored users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing these systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity the systems work by creating and describing identities recording activities and getting rid of unused identities according to the cloud security alliance the top three threats in the cloud are insecure interfaces and apis data loss leakage and hardware failurewhich accounted for 29 25 and 10 of all cloud security outages respectively together these form shared technology vulnerabilities in a cloud provider platform being shared by different users there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server additionally eugene schultz chief technology officer at emagined security said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud there are some real achilles heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attacka process he called hyperjacking some examples of this include the dropbox security breach and icloud 2014 leak dropbox had been breached in october 2014 having over seven million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by bitcoins btc by having these passwords they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines making the information public there is the problem of legal ownership of the data if a user stores some data in the cloud can the cloud provider profit from it many terms of service agreements are silent on the question of ownership physical control of the computer equipment private cloud is more secure than having the equipment offsite and under someone elses control public cloud this delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services some small businesses that do not have expertise in it security could find that it is more secure for them to use a public cloud there is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service persons sometimes do not read the many pages of the terms of service agreement and just click accept without reading this is important now that cloud computing is common and required for some services to work for example for an intelligent personal assistant apples siri or google assistant fundamentally private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user the attacks that can be made on cloud computing systems include maninthe middle attacks phishing attacks authentication attacks and malware attacks one of the largest threats is considered to be malware attacks such as trojan horses recent research conducted in 2022 has revealed that the trojan horse injection method is a serious problem with harmful impacts on cloud computing systems service models the national institute of standards and technology recognized three cloud service models in 2011 infrastructure as a service iaas platform as a service paas and software as a service saas the international organization for standardization iso later identified additional models in 2023 including network as a service communications as a service compute as a service and data storage as a service infrastructure as a service iaas infrastructure as a service iaas refers to online services that provide highlevel apis used to abstract various lowlevel details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources location data partitioning scaling security backup etc a hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers varying requirements linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying linux kernel technologies used to isolate secure and manage the containers the use of containers offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead iaas clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtualmachine diskimage library raw block storage file or object storage firewalls load balancers ip addresses virtual local area networks vlans and software bundles the nists definition of cloud computing describes iaas as where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage and deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components eg host firewalls iaascloud providers supply these resources ondemand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers for widearea connectivity customers can use either the internet or carrier clouds dedicated virtual private networks to deploy their applications cloud users install operatingsystem images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure in this model the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software cloud providers typically bill iaas services on a utility computing basis cost reflects the number of resources allocated and consumed platform as a service paas the nists definition of cloud computing defines platform as a service as the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumercreated or acquired applications created using programming languages libraries services and tools supported by the provider the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the applicationhosting environment paas vendors offer a development environment to application developers the provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment in the paas models cloud providers deliver a computing platform typically including an operating system programminglanguage execution environment database and the web server application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers with some paas the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually some integration and data management providers also use specialized applications of paas as delivery models for data examples include ipaas integration platform as a service and dpaas data platform as a service ipaas enables customers to develop execute and govern integration flows under the ipaas integration model customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware dpaas delivers integrationand datamanagementproducts as a fully managed service under the dpaas model the paas provider not the customer manages the development and execution of programs by building data applications for the customer dpaas users access data through datavisualization tools software as a service saas the nists definition of cloud computing defines software as a service as the capability provided to the consumer is to use the providers applications running on a cloud infrastructure the applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface such as a web browser eg webbased email or a program interface the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited userspecific application configuration settings in the software as a service saas model users gain access to application software and databases cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications saas is sometimes referred to as ondemand software and is usually priced on a payperuse basis or using a subscription fee in the saas model cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs this eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud users own computers which simplifies maintenance and support cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalabilitywhich can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at runtime to meet changing work demand load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines this process is transparent to the cloud user who sees only a single accesspoint to accommodate a large number of cloud users cloud applications can be multitenant meaning that any machine may serve more than one clouduser organization the pricing model for saas applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point it may also be free proponents claim that saas gives a business the potential to reduce it operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider this enables the business to reallocate it operations costs away from hardwaresoftware spending and from personnel expenses towards meeting other goals in addition with applications hosted centrally updates can be released without the need for users to install new software one drawback of saas comes with storing the users data on the cloud providers server as a result there could be unauthorized access to the data examples of applications offered as saas are games and productivity software like google docs and office online saas applications may be integrated with cloud storage or file hosting services which is the case with google docs being integrated with google drive and office online being integrated with onedrive backend as a service baas in the backend as a service m model also known as mobile backend as a service mbaas web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces apis exposed to their applications and custom software development kits sdks services include user management push notifications integration with social networking services and more this is a relatively recent model in cloud computing with most baas startups dating from 2011 or later but trends indicate that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers serverless computing and functionasaservice faas serverless computing is a cloud service category in which the customer can use different cloud capabilities types without the customer having to provision deploy and manage either hardware or software resources other than providing customer application code or providing customer data serverless computing represents a form of virtualized computing according to iso function as a service is a form of serverless computing deployment models the deployment of services to the cloud is referred to as cloud migration reverse cloud migration also known as cloud repatriation refers to moving cloudbased workloads back to onpremises infrastructures including enterprise data centers colocation providers and managed service providers cloud repatriation occurs due to security concerns costs performance issues compatibility problems and uptime concerns private private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization whether managed internally or by a third party and hosted either internally or externally undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources it can improve business but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities selfrun data centers are generally capital intensive they have a significant physical footprint requiring allocations of space hardware and environmental controls these assets have to be refreshed periodically resulting in additional capital expenditures they have attracted criticism because users still have to buy build and manage them and thus do not benefit from less handson management essentially lacking the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept public cloud services are considered public when they are delivered over the public internet and they may be offered as a paid subscription or free of charge architecturally there are few differences between public and privatecloud services but security concerns increase substantially when services applications storage and other resources are shared by multiple customers most publiccloud providers offer directconnection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloudresident applications several factors like the functionality of the solutions cost integrational and organizational aspects as well as safety security are influencing the decision of enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or onpremises solution hybrid hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment such as a private cloud or onpremises resources that remain distinct entities but are bound together offering the benefits of multiple deployment models hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation managed andor dedicated services with cloud resources gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private public and community cloud services from different service providers a hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one category of private public or community cloud service it allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service by aggregation integration or customization with another cloud service varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist for example an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service this example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements level of control needed over data and the applications an organization uses another example of hybrid cloud is one where it organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud this capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and bursts to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases a primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed cloud bursting enables data centers to create an inhouse it infrastructure that supports average workloads and use cloud resources from public or private clouds during spikes in processing demands others community community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns security compliance jurisdiction etc whether it is managed internally or by a thirdparty and hosted internally or externally the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud but more than a private cloud as a result only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved distributed a cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations connected to a single network or hub service it is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds publicresource computing and volunteer cloud publicresource computing this type of distributed cloud results from an expansive definition of cloud computing because they are more akin to distributed computing than cloud computing nonetheless it is considered a subclass of cloud computing volunteer cloud volunteer cloud computing is characterized as the intersection of publicresource computing and cloud computing where a cloud computing infrastructure is built using volunteered resources many challenges arise from this type of infrastructure because of the volatility of the resources used to build it and the dynamic environment it operates in it can also be called peertopeer clouds or adhoc clouds an interesting effort in such direction is cloudhome it aims to implement a cloud computing infrastructure using volunteered resources providing a businessmodel to incentivize contributions through financial restitution multi multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors increase flexibility through choice mitigate against disasters etc it differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services rather than multiple deployment modes public private legacy poly poly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers it differs from multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more than could be done with a single provider big data the issues of transferring large amounts of data to the cloud as well as data security once the data is in the cloud initially hampered adoption of cloud for big data but now that much data originates in the cloud and with the advent of baremetal servers the cloud has become a solution for use cases including business analytics and geospatial analysis hpc hpc cloud refers to the use of cloud computing services and infrastructure to execute highperformance computing hpc applications these applications consume a considerable amount of computing power and memory and are traditionally executed on clusters of computers in 2016 a handful of companies including rhpc amazon web services univa silicon graphics international sabalcore gomput and penguin computing offered a highperformance computing cloud the penguin on demand pod cloud was one of the first nonvirtualized remote hpc services offered on a payasyougo basis penguin computing launched its hpc cloud in 2016 as an alternative to amazons ec2 elastic compute cloud which uses virtualized computing nodes architecture cloud architecture the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others cloud engineering cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines of cloud computing it brings a systematic approach to the highlevel concerns of commercialization standardization and governance in conceiving developing operating and maintaining cloud computing systems it is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems software web performance information technology engineering security platform risk and quality engineering market according to international data corporation idc global spending on cloud computing services has reached 706 billion and is expected to reach 13 trillion by 2025 gartner estimated that global public cloud services enduser spending would reach 600 billion by 2023 according to a mckinsey company report cloud costoptimization levers and valueoriented business use cases foresee more than 1 trillion in runrate ebitda across fortune 500 companies as up for grabs in 2030 in 2022 more than 13 trillion in enterprise it spending was at stake from the shift to the cloud growing to almost 18 trillion in 2025 according to gartner the european commissions 2012 communication identified several issues which were impeding the development of the cloud computing market section 3 fragmentation of the digital single market across the eu concerns about contracts including reservations about data access and ownership data portability and change control variations in standards applicable to cloud computing the communication set out a series of digital agenda actions which the commission proposed to undertake in order to support the development of a fair and effective market for cloud computing services pages 614 list of public clouds adobe creative cloud amazon web services google cloud ibm cloud microsoft azure openstack oracle cloud panorama9 similar concepts the goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them the cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by it obstacles the main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more virtual devices each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks with operating systemlevel virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently virtualization provides the agility required to speed up it operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources ondemand by minimizing user involvement automation speeds up the process reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors cloud computing uses concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used cloud computing attempts to address qos quality of service and reliability problems of other grid computing models cloud computing shares characteristics with clientserver model clientserver computing refers broadly to any distributed application that distinguishes between service providers servers and service requestors clients computer bureau a service bureau providing computer services particularly from the 1960s to 1980s grid computing a form of distributed and parallel computing whereby a super and virtual computer is composed of a cluster of networked loosely coupled computers acting in concert to perform very large tasks fog computing distributed computing paradigm that provides data compute storage and application services closer to the client or nearuser edge devices such as network routers furthermore fog computing handles data at the network level on smart devices and on the enduser clientside eg mobile devices instead of sending data to a remote location for processing utility computing the packaging of computing resources such as computation and storage as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility such as electricity peertopeer a distributed architecture without the need for central coordination participants are both suppliers and consumers of resources in contrast to the traditional clientserver model cloud sandbox a live isolated computer environment in which a program code or file can run without affecting the application in which it runs see also notes references further reading millard christopher 2013 cloud computing law oxford university press isbn
