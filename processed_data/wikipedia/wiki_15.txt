automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes mainly by predetermining decision criteria subprocess relationships and related actions as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical hydraulic pneumatic electrical electronic devices and computers usually in combination complicated systems such as modern factories airplanes and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques the benefit of automation includes labor savings reducing waste savings in electricity costs savings in material costs and improvements to quality accuracy and precision automation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery processes in factories boilers and heattreating ovens switching on telephone networks steering stabilization of ships aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals automation has also found a home in the banking industry it can range from simple onoff control to multivariable highlevel algorithms in terms of control complexity in the simplest type of an automatic control loop a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances this closedloop control is an application of negative feedback to a system the mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th the term automation inspired by the earlier word automatic coming from automaton was not widely used before 1947 when ford established an automation department it was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers which were introduced in the 1930s the world banks world development report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist protectionist and populist politics in the us uk and france among other countries since the 2010s history early history it was a preoccupation of the greeks and arabs in the period between about 300 bc and about 1200 ad to keep accurate track of time in ptolemaic egypt about 270 bc ctesibius described a float regulator for a water clock a device not unlike the ball and cock in a modern flush toilet this was the earliest feedbackcontrolled mechanism the appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete the persian ban ms brothers in their book of ingenious devices 850 ad described a number of automatic controls twostep level controls for fluids a form of discontinuous variable structure controls were developed by the banu musa brothers they also described a feedback controller the design of feedback control systems up through the industrial revolution was by trialanderror together with a great deal of engineering intuition it was not until the mid19th century that the stability of feedback control systems was analyzed using mathematics the formal language of automatic control theory the centrifugal governor was invented by christiaan huygens in the seventeenth century and used to adjust the gap between millstones industrial revolution in western europe the introduction of prime movers or selfdriven machines advanced grain mills furnaces boilers and the steam engine created a new requirement for automatic control systems including temperature regulators invented in 1624 see cornelius drebbel pressure regulators 1681 float regulators 1700 and speed control devices another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills it was patented by edmund lee in 1745 also in 1745 jacques de vaucanson invented the first automated loom around 1800 joseph marie jacquard created a punchcard system to program looms in 1771 richard arkwright invented the first fully automated spinning mill driven by water power known at the time as the water frame an automatic flour mill was developed by oliver evans in 1785 making it the first completely automated industrial process a centrifugal governor was used by mr bunce of england in 1784 as part of a model steam crane the centrifugal governor was adopted by james watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after watts partner boulton saw one at a flour mill boulton watt were building the governor could not actually hold a set speed the engine would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes the governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler also there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change as a consequence engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed such as cotton spinning several improvements to the governor plus improvements to valve cutoff timing on the steam engine made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science both thermodynamics and control theory the governor received relatively little scientific attention until james clerk maxwell published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory 20th century relay logic was introduced with factory electrification which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 through the 1920s central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and the operation of new highpressure boilers steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls central control rooms became common in the 1920s but as late as the early 1930s most process controls were onoff operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments to make corrections operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off control rooms also used colorcoded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes the development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s which was important for longdistance telephony required a higher signaltonoise ratio which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation this and other telephony applications contributed to the control theory in the 1940s and 1950s german mathematician irmgard flggelotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls which found military applications during the second world war to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems controllers which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than onoff control began being introduced in the 1930s controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification factory productivity was greatly increased by electrification in the 1920s us manufacturing productivity growth fell from 52yr 191929 to 276yr 192941 alexander field notes that spending on nonmedical instruments increased significantly from 1929 to 1933 and remained strong thereafter the first and second world wars saw major advancements in the field of mass communication and signal processing other key advances in automatic controls include differential equations stability theory and system theory 1938 frequency domain analysis 1940 ship control 1950 and stochastic analysis 1941 starting in 1958 various systems based on solidstate digital logic modules for hardwired programmed logic controllers the predecessors of programmable logic controllers plc emerged to replace electromechanical relay logic in industrial control systems for process control and automation including early telefunkenaeg logistat siemens simatic philipsmullardvalvo norbit bbc sigmatronic acec logacec akkord estacord krone mibakron bistat datapac norlog ssr or procontic systems in 1959 texacos port arthur refinery became the first chemical plant to use digital control conversion of factories to digital control began to spread rapidly in the 1970s as the price of computer hardware fell significant applications the automatic telephone switchboard was introduced in 1892 along with dial telephones by 1929 319 of the bell system was automatic 158 automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electromechanical switches which consumed a large amount of electricity call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production prompting bell labs to begin research on the transistor the logic performed by telephone switching relays was the inspiration for the digital computer the first commercially successful glass bottleblowing machine was an automatic model introduced in 1905 the machine operated by a twoman crew working 12hour shifts could produce 17280 bottles in 24 hours compared to 2880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day the cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to 180 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers sectional electric drives were developed using control theory sectional electric drives are used on different sections of a machine where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections in steel rolling the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers which must run at successively faster speeds in paper making paper the sheet shrinks as it passes around steamheated drying arranged in groups which must run at successively slower speeds the first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919 one of the most important developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling developed by armco in 1928 before automation many chemicals were made in batches in 1930 with the widespread use of instruments and the emerging use of controllers the founder of dow chemical co was advocating continuous production selfacting machine tools that displaced hand dexterity so they could be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by james nasmyth in the 1840s machine tools were automated with numerical control nc using punched paper tape in the 1950s this soon evolved into computerized numerical control cnc today extensive automation is practiced in practically every type of manufacturing and assembly process some of the larger processes include electrical power generation oil refining chemicals steel mills plastics cement plants fertilizer plants pulp and paper mills automobile and truck assembly aircraft production glass manufacturing natural gas separation plants food and beverage processing canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines spacecomputer age with the advent of the space age in 1957 controls design particularly in the united states turned away from the frequencydomain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century which were couched in the time domain during the 1940s and 1950s german mathematician irmgard fluggelotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control which became widely used in hysteresis control systems such as navigation systems firecontrol systems and electronics through fluggelotz and others the modern era saw timedomain design for nonlinear systems 1961 navigation 1960 optimal control and estimation theory 1962 nonlinear control theory 1969 digital control and filtering theory 1974 and the personal computer 1983 advantages disadvantages and limitations perhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs another benefit could be that it replaces hard physical or monotonous work additionally tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic they can also be maintained with simple quality checks however at the time being not all tasks can be automated and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself moreover some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage however these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature and could potentially be circumvented the main advantages of automation are increased throughput or productivity improved quality increased predictability improved robustness consistency of processes or product increased consistency of output reduced direct human labor costs and expenses reduced cycle time increased accuracy relieving humans of monotonously repetitive work required work in development deployment maintenance and operation of automated processes often structured as jobs increased human freedom to do other things automation primarily describes machines replacing human action but it is also loosely associated with mechanization machines replacing human labor coupled with mechanization extending human capabilities in terms of size strength speed endurance visual range acuity hearing frequency precision electromagnetic sensing effecting etc advantages include relieving humans of dangerous work stresses and occupational injuries eg fewer strained backs from lifting heavy objects removing humans from dangerous environments eg fire space volcanoes nuclear facilities underwater etc the main disadvantages of automation are high initial cost faster production without human intervention can mean faster unchecked production of defects where automated processes are defective scaledup capacities can mean scaledup problems when systems fail releasing dangerous toxins forces energies etc at scaledup rates human adaptiveness is often poorly understood by automation initiators it is often difficult to anticipate every contingency and develop fully preplanned automated responses for every situation the discoveries inherent in automating processes can require unanticipated iterations to resolve causing unanticipated costs and delays people anticipating employment income may be seriously disrupted by others deploying automation where no similar income is readily available paradox of automation the paradox of automation says that the more efficient the automated system the more crucial the human contribution of the operators humans are less involved but their involvement becomes more critical lisanne bainbridge a cognitive psychologist identified these issues notably in her widely cited paper ironies of automation if an automated system has an error it will multiply that error until it is fixed or shut down this is where human operators come in a fatal example of this was air france flight 447 where a failure of automation put the pilots into a manual situation they were not prepared for limitations current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and produce high volumes of products making malfunctions extremely costly and potentially hazardous therefore some personnel is needed to ensure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained as a process becomes increasingly automated there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained this is an example of both diminishing returns and the logistic function as more and more processes become automated there are fewer remaining nonautomated processes this is an example of the exhaustion of opportunities new technological paradigms may however set new limits that surpass the previous limits current limitations many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation humanlevel pattern recognition language comprehension and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems but see watson computer tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data such as scents and sounds as well as highlevel tasks such as strategic planning currently require human expertise in many cases the use of humans is more costeffective than mechanical approaches even where the automation of industrial tasks is possible therefore algorithmic management as the digital rationalization of human labor instead of its substitution has emerged as an alternative technological strategy overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to postscarcity economics societal impact and unemployment increased automation often causes workers to feel anxious about losing their jobs as technology renders their skills or experience unnecessary early in the industrial revolution when inventions like the steam engine were making some job categories expendable workers forcefully resisted these changes luddites for instance were english textile workers who protested the introduction of weaving machines by destroying them more recently some residents of chandler arizona have slashed tires and pelted rocks at selfdriving car in protest over the cars perceived threat to human safety and job prospects the relative anxiety about automation reflected in opinion polls seems to correlate closely with the strength of organized labor in that region or nation for example while a study by the pew research center indicated that 72 of americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace 80 of swedes see automation and artificial intelligence ai as a good thing due to the countrys stillpowerful unions and a more robust national safety net in the us 47 of all current jobs have the potential to be fully automated by 2033 according to the research of experts carl benedikt frey and michael osborne furthermore wages and educational attainment appear to be strongly negatively correlated with an occupations risk of being automated even highly skilled professional jobs like a lawyer doctor engineer journalist are at risk of automation prospects are particularly bleak for occupations that do not presently require a university degree such as truck driving even in hightech corridors like silicon valley concern is spreading about a future in which a sizable percentage of adults have little chance of sustaining gainful employment in the second machine age erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee argue that theres never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education because these people can use technology to create and capture value however theres never been a worse time to be a worker with only ordinary skills and abilities to offer because computers robots and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate as the example of sweden suggests however the transition to a more automated future need not inspire panic if there is sufficient political will to promote the retraining of workers whose positions are being rendered obsolete according to a 2020 study in the journal of political economy automation has robust negative effects on employment and wages one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employmenttopopulation ratio by 02 percentage points and wages by 042 research by carl benedikt frey and michael osborne of the oxford martin school argued that employees engaged in tasks following welldefined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms are at risk of displacement and 47 of jobs in the us were at risk the study released as a working paper in 2013 and published in 2017 predicted that automation would put lowpaid physical occupations most at risk by surveying a group of colleagues on their opinions however according to a study published in mckinsey quarterly in 2015 the impact of computerization in most cases is not the replacement of employees but the automation of portions of the tasks they perform the methodology of the mckinsey study has been heavily criticized for being intransparent and relying on subjective assessments the methodology of frey and osborne has been subjected to criticism as lacking evidence historical awareness or credible methodology additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd found that across the 21 oecd countries 9 of jobs are automatable the obama administration pointed out that every 3 months about 6 percent of jobs in the economy are destroyed by shrinking or closing businesses while a slightly larger percentage of jobs are added a recent mit economics study of automation in the us from 1990 to 2007 found that there may be a negative impact on employment and wages when robots are introduced to an industry when one robot is added per one thousand workers the employment to population ratio decreases between 018 and 034 percentages and wages are reduced by 02505 percentage points during the time period studied the us did not have many robots in the economy which restricts the impact of automation however automation is expected to triple conservative estimate or quadruple a generous estimate leading these numbers to become substantially higher based on a formula by gilles saintpaul an economist at toulouse 1 university the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases in the long run and for society as a whole it has led to cheaper products lower average work hours and new industries forming ie robotics industries computer industries design industries these new industries provide many high salary skillbased jobs to the economy by 2030 between 3 and 14 percent of the global workforce will be forced to switch job categories due to automation eliminating jobs in an entire sector while the number of jobs lost to automation is often offset by jobs gained from technological advances the same type of job loss is not the same one replaced and that leading to increasing unemployment in the lowermiddle class this occurs largely in the us and developed countries where technological advances contribute to higher demand for highly skilled labor but demand for middlewage labor continues to fall economists call this trend income polarization where unskilled labor wages are driven down and skilled labor is driven up and it is predicted to continue in developed economies unemployment is becoming a problem in the us due to the exponential growth rate of automation and technology according to kim kim and lee 20171 a seminal study by frey and osborne in 2013 predicted that 47 of the 702 examined occupations in the us faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 1025 years as a result of computerization as many jobs are becoming obsolete which is causing job displacement one possible solution would be for the government to assist with a universal basic income ubi program ubi would be a guaranteed nontaxed income of around 1000 dollars per month paid to all us citizens over the age of 21 ubi would help those who are displaced take on jobs that pay less money and still afford to get by it would also give those that are employed with jobs that are likely to be replaced by automation and technology extra money to spend on education and training on new demanding employment skills ubi however should be seen as a shortterm solution as it doesnt fully address the issue of income inequality which will be exacerbated by job displacement lightsout manufacturing lightsout manufacturing is a production system with no human workers to eliminate labor costs lights out manufacturing grew in popularity in the us when general motors in 1982 implemented humans handsoff manufacturing to replace riskaverse bureaucracy with automation and robots however the factory never reached full lights out status the expansion of lights out manufacturing requires reliability of equipment longterm mechanic capabilities planned preventive maintenance commitment from the staff health and environment the costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology product or engine automated there are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the earth in comparison with previous engines and vice versa hazardous operations such as oil refining the manufacturing of industrial chemicals and all forms of metal working were always early contenders for automation the automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors because automated vehicles are much less likely to get into accidents compared to humandriven vehicles some precautions built into current models such as antilock brakes or laminated glass would not be required for selfdriving versions removal of these safety features reduces the weight of the vehicle and coupled with more precise acceleration and braking as well as fuelefficient route mapping can increase fuel economy and reduce emissions despite this some researchers theorize that an increase in the production of selfdriving cars could lead to a boom in vehicle ownership and usage which could potentially negate any environmental benefits of selfdriving cars if they are used more frequently automation of homes and home appliances is also thought to impact the environment a study of energy consumption of automated homes in finland showed that smart homes could reduce energy consumption by monitoring levels of consumption in different areas of the home and adjusting consumption to reduce energy leaks eg automatically reducing consumption during the nighttime when activity is low this study along with others indicated that the smart homes ability to monitor and adjust consumption levels would reduce unnecessary energy usage however some research suggests that smart homes might not be as efficient as nonautomated homes a more recent study has indicated that while monitoring and adjusting consumption levels do decrease unnecessary energy use this process requires monitoring systems that also consume an amount of energy the energy required to run these systems sometimes negates their benefits resulting in little to no ecological benefit convertibility and turnaround time another major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing product a to manufacturing product b without having to completely rebuild the production lines flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of automated guided vehicles with natural features navigation digital electronics helped too former analogbased instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration parametrization and operation this was accompanied by the fieldbus revolution which provided a networked ie a single cable means of communicating between control systems and fieldlevel instrumentation eliminating hardwiring discrete manufacturing plants adopted these technologies fast the more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analogbased measurement and control still dominate the growing use of industrial ethernet on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise via the internet if necessary global competition has also increased demand for reconfigurable manufacturing systems automation tools engineers can now have numerical control over automated devices the result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities computeraided technologies or cax now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems notable examples of cax include computeraided design cad software and computeraided manufacturing cam software the improved design analysis and manufacture of products enabled by cax has been beneficial for industry information technology together with industrial machinery and processes can assist in the design implementation and monitoring of control systems one example of an industrial control system is a programmable logic controller plc plcs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from physical sensors and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events humanmachine interfaces hmi or computer human interfaces chi formerly known as manmachine interfaces are usually employed to communicate with plcs and other computers service personnel who monitor and control through hmis can be called by different names in the industrial process and manufacturing environments they are called operators or something similar in boiler houses and central utility departments they are called stationary engineers different types of automation tools exist ann artificial neural network dcs distributed control system hmi human machine interface rpa robotic process automation scada supervisory control and data acquisition plc programmable logic controller instrumentation motion control robotics host simulation software hss is a commonly used testing tool that is used to test the equipment software hss is used to test equipment performance concerning factory automation standards timeouts response time processing time cognitive automation cognitive automation as a subset of ai is an emerging genus of automation enabled by cognitive computing its primary concern is the automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring unstructured data cognitive automation relies on multiple disciplines natural language processing realtime computing machine learning algorithms big data analytics and evidencebased learning according to deloitte cognitive automation enables the replication of human tasks and judgment at rapid speeds and considerable scale such tasks include document redaction data extraction and document synthesis reporting contract management natural language search customer employee and stakeholder onboarding manual activities and verifications followup and email communications recent and emerging applications cad ai artificially intelligent computeraided design cad can use textto3d imageto3d and videoto3d to automate in 3d modeling ai cad libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams ai cad assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow automated power production technologies like solar panels wind turbines and other renewable energy sourcestogether with smart grids microgrids battery storagecan automate power production agricultural production many agricultural operations are automated with machinery and equipment to improve their diagnosis decisionmaking andor performing agricultural automation can relieve the drudgery of agricultural work improve the timeliness and precision of agricultural operations raise productivity and resourceuse efficiency build resilience and improve food quality and safety increased productivity can free up labour allowing agricultural households to spend more time elsewhere the technological evolution in agriculture has resulted in progressive shifts to digital equipment and robotics motorized mechanization using engine power automates the performance of agricultural operations such as ploughing and milking with digital automation technologies it also becomes possible to automate diagnosis and decisionmaking of agricultural operations for example autonomous crop robots can harvest and seed crops while drones can gather information to help automate input application precision agriculture often employs such automation technologies motorized mechanization has generally increased in recent years subsaharan africa is the only region where the adoption of motorized mechanization has stalled over the past decades automation technologies are increasingly used for managing livestock though evidence on adoption is lacking global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years but adoption is likely mostly in northern europe and likely almost absent in low and middleincome countries automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce retail many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing selfcheckout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers in the us the retail industry employs 159 million people as of 2017 around 1 in 9 americans in the workforce globally an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by eurasia group online shopping could be considered a form of automated retail as the payment and checkout are through an automated online transaction processing system with the share of online retail accounting jumping from 51 in 2011 to 83 in 2016 however twothirds of books music and films are now purchased online in addition automation and online shopping could reduce demands for shopping malls and retail property which in the united states is currently estimated to account for 31 of all commercial property or around 7 billion square feet 650 million square metres amazon has gained much of the growth in recent years for online shopping accounting for half of the growth in online retail in 2016 other forms of automation can also be an integral part of online shopping for example the deployment of automated warehouse robotics such as that applied by amazon using kiva systems food and drink the food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process mcdonalds has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants reducing the need for as many cashier employees the university of texas at austin has introduced fully automated cafe retail locations some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet apps to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device some restaurants have automated food delivery to tables of customers using a conveyor belt system the use of robots is sometimes employed to replace waiting staff construction automation in construction is the combination of methods processes and systems that allow for greater machine autonomy in construction activities construction automation may have multiple goals including but not limited to reducing jobsite injuries decreasing activity completion times and assisting with quality control and quality assurance mining automated mining involves the removal of human labor from the mining process the mining industry is currently in the transition towards automation currently it can still require a large amount of human capital particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation video surveillance the defense advanced research projects agency darpa started the research and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring vsam program between 1997 and 1999 and airborne video surveillance avs programs from 1998 to 2002 currently there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fullyautomated tracking surveillance system automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in realtime within a busy environment existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe ie indoor outdoor or airborne the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensors ie stationary camera vs mobile camera the purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area generate warnings or notify the designated authorities in case of occurrence of particular events highway systems as demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied interest in automation has grown seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways the us congress authorized more than 650 million over six years for intelligent transport systems its and demonstration projects in the 1991 intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea congress legislated in istea thatthe secretary of transportation shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehiclehighway systems can be developed such development shall include research in human factors to ensure the success of the manmachine relationship the goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997 this system shall accommodate the installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehiclesfull automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor computer and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway fully automated driving would in theory allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible politically unacceptable or prohibitively expensive automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes other potential benefits include improved air quality as a result of moreefficient traffic flows increased fuel economy and spinoff technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems waste management automated waste collection trucks prevent the need for as many workers as well as easing the level of labor required to provide the service business process business process automation bpa is the technologyenabled automation of complex business processes it can help to streamline a business for simplicity achieve digital transformation increase service quality improve service delivery or contain costs bpa consists of integrating applications restructuring labor resources and using software applications throughout the organization robotic process automation rpa or rpaai for selfguided rpa 20 is an emerging field within bpa and uses ai bpas can be implemented in a number of business areas including marketing sales and workflow home home automation also called domotics designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades the rise in the usage of home automation solutions has taken a turn reflecting the increased dependency of people on such automation solutions however the increased comfort that gets added through these automation solutions is remarkable laboratory automation is essential for many scientific and clinical applications therefore automation has been extensively employed in laboratories from as early as 1980 fully automated laboratories have already been working however automation has not become widespread in laboratories due to its high cost this may change with the ability of integrating lowcost devices with standard laboratory equipment autosamplers are common devices used in laboratory automation logistics automation logistics automation is the application of computer software or automated machinery to improve the efficiency of logistics operations typically this refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center with broader tasks undertaken by supply chain engineering systems and enterprise resource planning systems industrial automation industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing quality control and material handling processes generalpurpose controllers for industrial processes include programmable logic controllers standalone io modules and computers industrial automation is to replace the human action and manual commandresponse activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands one trend is increased use of machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions another is a continuing increase in the use of robots industrial automation is simply required in industries industrial automation and industry 40 the rise of industrial automation is directly tied to the fourth industrial revolution which is better known now as industry 40 originating from germany industry 40 encompasses numerous devices concepts and machines as well as the advancement of the industrial internet of things iiot an internet of things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the internet through a virtual representation these new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities industry 40 works with the iiot and softwarehardware to connect in a way that through communication technologies add enhancements and improve manufacturing processes being able to create smarter safer and more advanced manufacturing is now possible with these new technologies it opens up a manufacturing platform that is more reliable consistent and efficient than before implementation of systems such as scada is an example of software that takes place in industrial automation today scada is a supervisory data collection software just one of the many used in industrial automation industry 40 vastly covers many areas in manufacturing and will continue to do so as time goes on industrial robotics industrial robotics is a subbranch in industrial automation that aids in various manufacturing processes such manufacturing processes include machining welding painting assembling and material handling to name a few industrial robots use various mechanical electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision accuracy and speed that far exceed any human performance the birth of industrial robots came shortly after world war ii as the us saw the need for a quicker way to produce industrial and consumer goods servos digital logic and solidstate electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and over time these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance in 1997 there were 700000 industrial robots in use the number has risen to 18m in 2017 in recent years ai with robotics is also used in creating an automatic labeling solution using robotic arms as the automatic label applicator and ai for learning and detecting the products to be labelled programmable logic controllers industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process programmable logic controllers plcs use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming plcs make use of programmable memory storing instructions and functions like logic sequencing timing counting etc using a logicbased language a plc can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors valves etc plcs are similar to computers however while computers are optimized for calculations plcs are optimized for control tasks and use in industrial environments they are built so that only basic logicbased programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations high temperatures humidity and noise the greatest advantage plcs offer is their flexibility with the same basic controllers a plc can operate a range of different control systems plcs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system this flexibility leads to a costeffective system for complex and varied control systems plcs can range from small building brick devices with tens of io in a housing integral with the processor to large rackmounted modular devices with a count of thousands of io and which are often networked to other plc and scada systems they can be designed for multiple arrangements of digital and analog inputs and outputs io extended temperature ranges immunity to electrical noise and resistance to vibration and impact programs to control machine operation are typically stored in batterybackedup or nonvolatile memory it was from the automotive industry in the united states that the plc was born before the plc control sequencing and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays cam timers drum sequencers and dedicated closedloop controllers since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model changeover was very timeconsuming and expensive as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics when digital computers became available being generalpurpose programmable devices they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes however these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature cleanliness and power quality to meet these challenges the plc was developed with several key attributes it would tolerate the shopfloor environment it would support discrete bitform input and output in an easily extensible manner it would not require years of training to use and it would permit its operation to be monitored since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times modern fast small reliable electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers and performance could be traded off for reliability agentassisted automation agentassisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries the key benefit of agentassisted automation is compliance and errorproofing agents are sometimes not fully trained or they forget or ignore key steps in the process the use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does every time there are two basic types desktop automation and automated voice solutions control openloop and closedloop discrete control onoff one of the simplest types of control is onoff control an example is a thermostat used on household appliances which either open or close an electrical contact thermostats were originally developed as true feedbackcontrol mechanisms rather than the onoff common household appliance thermostat sequence control in which a programmed sequence of discrete operations is performed often based on system logic that involves system states an elevator control system is an example of sequence control pid controller a proportionalintegralderivative controller pid controller is a control loop feedback mechanism controller widely used in industrial control systems in a pid loop the controller continuously calculates an error value e t displaystyle et as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional integral and derivative terms respectively sometimes denoted p i and d which give their name to the controller type the theoretical understanding and application date from the 1920s and they are implemented in nearly all analog control systems originally in mechanical controllers and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers sequential control and logical sequence or system state control sequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states an example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler states refer to the various conditions that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system an example is an elevator which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input for example if the operator presses the floor n button the system will respond depending on whether the elevator is stopped or moving going up or down or if the door is open or closed and other conditions early development of sequential control was relay logic by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices such as when starting and stopping industrialsized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves using relays for control purposes allowed eventdriven control where actions could be triggered out of sequence in response to external events these were more flexible in their response than the rigid singlesequence cam timers more complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed the total number of relays and cam timers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable one of the first being ladder logic where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder special computers called programmable logic controllers were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single more easily reprogrammed unit in a typical hardwired motor start and stop circuit called a control circuit a motor is started by pushing a start or run button that activates a pair of electrical relays the lockin relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the pushbutton is released the start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is a normally closed contact another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch three sets of contacts for threephase industrial power in the main power circuit large motors use high voltage and experience high inrush current making speed important in making and breaking contact this can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches the lockin contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a stop or off button is pressed which deenergizes the lock in relay commonly interlocks are added to a control circuit suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication in this case an interlock could be added to ensure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts timers limit switches and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits solenoid valves are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering actuators on mechanical components while motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component such as moving various mechanical arms opening or closing valves raising heavy pressrolls applying pressure to presses computer control computers can perform both sequential control and feedback control and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application programmable logic controllers plcs are a type of specialpurpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logictype systems generalpurpose process control computers have increasingly replaced standalone controllers with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers process control computers can process data from a network of plcs instruments and controllers to implement typical such as pid control of many individual variables or in some cases to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations they can also analyze data and create realtime graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators engineers and management control of an automated teller machine atm is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logicderived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database the atm process has similarities with other online transaction processes the different logical responses are called scenarios such processes are typically designed with the aid of use cases and flowcharts
