big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional dataprocessing software data with many entries rows offer greater statistical power while data with higher complexity more attributes or columns may lead to a higher false discovery rate big data analysis challenges include capturing data data storage data analysis search sharing transfer visualization querying updating information privacy and data source big data was originally associated with three key concepts volume variety and velocity the analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling thus a fourth concept veracity refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organizations capacity to create and capture value from big data current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics user behavior analytics or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data and seldom to a particular size of data set there is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large but thats not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem analysis of data sets can find new correlations to spot business trends prevent diseases combat crime and so on scientists business executives medical practitioners advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large datasets in areas including internet searches fintech healthcare analytics geographic information systems urban informatics and business informatics scientists encounter limitations in escience work including meteorology genomics connectomics complex physics simulations biology and environmental research the size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices cheap and numerous informationsensing internet of things devices aerial remote sensing equipment software logs cameras microphones radiofrequency identification rfid readers and wireless sensor networks the worlds technological percapita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s as of 2012 every day 25 exabytes 217260 bytes of data are generated based on an idc report prediction the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 44 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020 by 2025 idc predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data according to idc global spending on big data and business analytics bda solutions is estimated to reach 2157 billion in 2021 while statista report the global big data market is forecasted to grow to 103 billion by 2027 in 2011 mckinsey company reported if us healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality the sector could create more than 300 billion in value every year in the developed economies of europe government administrators could save more than 100 billion 149 billion in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data and users of services enabled by personallocation data could capture 600 billion in consumer surplus one question for large enterprises is determining who should own bigdata initiatives that affect the entire organization relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data the processing and analysis of big data may require massively parallel software running on tens hundreds or even thousands of servers what qualifies as big data varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools furthermore expanding capabilities make big data a moving target for some organizations facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options for others it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration definition the term big data has been in use since the 1990s with some giving credit to john mashey for popularizing the term big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture curate manage and process data within a tolerable elapsed time big data philosophy encompasses unstructured semistructured and structured data however the main focus is on unstructured data big data size is a constantly moving target as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from datasets that are diverse complex and of a massive scale volume variety velocity and various other vs are added by some organizations to describe it a revision challenged by some industry authorities the vs of big data were often referred to as the three vs four vs and five vs they represented the qualities of big data in volume variety velocity veracity and value variability is often included as an additional quality of big data a 2018 definition states big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data and notes this represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used via parallel programming theories and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by codds relational model in a comparative study of big datasets kitchin and mcardle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases for this reason other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait instead of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of big data this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected stored made available and analyzed big data vs business intelligence the growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between big data and business intelligence business intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things detect trends etc big data uses mathematical analysis optimization inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification to infer laws regressions nonlinear relationships and causal effects from large sets of data with low information density to reveal relationships and dependencies or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors characteristics big data can be described by the following characteristics volume the quantity of generated and stored data the size of the data determines the value and potential insight and whether it can be considered big data or not the size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes variety the type and nature of the data earlier technologies like rdbmss were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively however the change in type and nature from structured to semistructured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture store and process the semistructured and unstructured variety data generated with high speed velocity and huge in size volume later these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage eventually the processing of structured data was still kept as optional either using big data or traditional rdbmss this helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media log files sensors etc big data draws from text images audio video plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion velocity the speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development big data is often available in realtime compared to small data big data is produced more continually two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling recording and publishing veracity the truthfulness or reliability of the data which refers to the data quality and the data value big data must not only be large in size but also must be reliable in order to achieve value in the analysis of it the data quality of captured data can vary greatly affecting an accurate analysis value the worth in information that can be achieved by the processing and analysis of large datasets value also can be measured by an assessment of the other qualities of big data value may also represent the profitability of information that is retrieved from the analysis of big data variability the characteristic of the changing formats structure or sources of big data big data can include structured unstructured or combinations of structured and unstructured data big data analysis may integrate raw data from multiple sources the processing of raw data may also involve transformations of unstructured data to structured data other possible characteristics of big data are exhaustive whether the entire system ie n textstyle n all is captured or recorded or not big data may or may not include all the available data from sources finegrained and uniquely lexical respectively the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified relational if the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining or metaanalysis of different data sets extensional if new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily scalability if the size of the big data storage system can expand rapidly architecture big data repositories have existed in many forms often built by corporations with a special need commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s for many years wintercorp published the largest database report teradata corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing dbc 1012 system teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992 hard disk drives were 25 gb in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves teradata installed the first petabyte class rdbms based system in 2007 as of 2017 there are a few dozen petabyte class teradata relational databases installed the largest of which exceeds 50 pb systems up until 2008 were 100 structured relational data since then teradata has added semi structured data types including xml json and avro in 2000 seisint inc now lexisnexis risk solutions developed a cbased distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the hpcc systems platform this system automatically partitions distributes stores and delivers structured semistructured and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ecl data analysts working in ecl are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution in 2004 lexisnexis acquired seisint inc and their highspeed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of choicepoint inc when they acquired that company in 2008 in 2011 the hpcc systems platform was opensourced under the apache v20 license cern and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades usually analyzed via highthroughput computing rather than the mapreduce architectures usually meant by the current big data movement in 2004 google published a paper on a process called mapreduce that uses a similar architecture the mapreduce concept provides a parallel processing model and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data with mapreduce queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel the map step the results are then gathered and delivered the reduce step the framework was very successful so others wanted to replicate the algorithm therefore an implementation of the mapreduce framework was adopted by an apache opensource project named hadoop apache spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the mapreduce paradigm as it adds inmemory processing and the ability to set up many operations not just map followed by reducing mike20 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled big data solution offering the methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources complexity in interrelationships and difficulty in deleting or modifying individual records studies in 2012 showed that a multiplelayer architecture was one option to address the issues that big data presents a distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds this type of architecture inserts data into a parallel dbms which implements the use of mapreduce and hadoop frameworks this type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the enduser by using a frontend application server the data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management this enables quick segregation of data into the data lake thereby reducing the overhead time technologies a 2011 mckinsey global institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows techniques for analyzing data such as ab testing machine learning and natural language processing big data technologies like business intelligence cloud computing and databases visualization such as charts graphs and other displays of the data multidimensional big data can also be represented as olap data cubes or mathematically tensors array database systems have set out to provide storage and highlevel query support on this data type additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensorbased computation such as multilinear subspace learning massively parallelprocessing mpp databases searchbased applications data mining distributed file systems distributed cache eg burst buffer and memcached distributed databases cloud and hpcbased infrastructure applications storage and computing resources and the internet although many approaches and technologies have been developed it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data some mpp relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data implicit is the ability to load monitor back up and optimize the use of the large data tables in the rdbms darpas topological data analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called ayasdi the practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage preferring directattached storage das in its various forms from solid state drive ssd to high capacity sata disk buried inside parallel processing nodes the perception of shared storage architecturesstorage area network san and networkattached storage nas is that they are relatively slow complex and expensive these qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance commodity infrastructure and low cost real or nearrealtime information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible data in directattached memory or disk is gooddata on memory or disk at the other end of an fc san connection is not the cost of an san at the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage techniques applications big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that software ag oracle corporation ibm microsoft sap emc hp and dell have spent more than 15 billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics in 2010 this industry was worth more than 100 billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year about twice as fast as the software business as a whole developed economies increasingly use dataintensive technologies there are 46 billion mobilephone subscriptions worldwide and between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet between 1990 and 2005 more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class which means more people became more literate which in turn led to information growth the worlds effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986 471 petabytes in 1993 22 exabytes in 2000 65 exabytes in 2007 and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014 according to one estimate onethird of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data which is the format most useful for most big data applications this also shows the potential of yet unused data ie in the form of video and audio content while many vendors offer offtheshelf products for big data experts promote the development of inhouse customtailored systems if the company has sufficient technical capabilities government the use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost productivity and innovation but comes with flaws data analysis often requires multiple parts of government central and local to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome a common government organization that makes use of big data is the national security administration nsa which monitors the activities of the internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their system may pick up civil registration and vital statistics crvs collects all certificates status from birth to death crvs is a source of big data for governments international development research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development also known as ict4d suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to international development advancements in big data analysis offer costeffective opportunities to improve decisionmaking in critical development areas such as health care employment economic productivity crime security and natural disaster and resource management additionally usergenerated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice however longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy imperfect methodology and interoperability issues the challenge of big data for development is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning known as artificial intelligence for development ai4d benefits a major practical application of big data for development has been fighting poverty with data in 2015 blumenstock and colleagues estimated predicted poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata and in 2016 jean and colleagues combined satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty using digital trace data to study the labor market and the digital economy in latin america hilbert and colleagues argue that digital trace data has several benefits such as thematic coverage including areas that were previously difficult or impossible to measure geographical coverage providing sizable and comparable data for almost all countries including many small countries that usually are not included in international inventories level of detail providing finegrained data with many interrelated variables and new aspects like network connections timeliness and timeseries graphs can be produced within days of being collected challenges at the same time working with digital trace data instead of traditional survey data does not eliminate the traditional challenges involved when working in the field of international quantitative analysis priorities change but the basic discussions remain the same among the main challenges are representativeness while traditional development statistics is mainly concerned with the representativeness of random survey samples digital trace data is never a random sample generalizability while observational data always represents this source very well it only represents what it represents and nothing more while it is tempting to generalize from specific observations of one platform to broader settings this is often very deceptive harmonization digital trace data still requires international harmonization of indicators it adds the challenge of socalled datafusion the harmonization of different sources data overload analysts and institutions are not used to effectively deal with a large number of variables which is efficiently done with interactive dashboards practitioners still lack a standard workflow that would allow researchers users and policymakers to efficiently and effectively deal with data finance big data is being rapidly adopted in finance to 1 speed up processing and 2 deliver better more informed inferences both internally and to the clients of the financial institutions the financial applications of big data range from investing decisions and trading processing volumes of available price data limit order books economic data and more all at the same time portfolio management optimizing over an increasingly large array of financial instruments potentially selected from different asset classes risk management credit rating based on extended information and any other aspect where the data inputs are large big data has also been a typical concept within the field of alternative financial service some of the major areas involve crowdfunding platforms and crypto currency exchanges healthcare big data analytics has been used in healthcare in providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics waste and care variability reduction automated external and internal reporting of patient data standardized medical terms and patient registries some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented the level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial with the added adoption of mhealth ehealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase this includes electronic health record data imaging data patient generated data sensor data and other forms of difficult to process data there is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality big data very often means dirty data and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed while extensive information in healthcare is now electronic it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use the use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights privacy and autonomy to transparency and trust big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research as datadriven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesisdriven research then trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional hypothesisdriven follow up biological research and eventually clinical research a related application subarea that heavily relies on big data within the healthcare field is that of computeraided diagnosis in medicine for instance for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create 5 to 10 gb of data daily similarly a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages 450 mb of data these are just a few of the many examples where computeraided diagnosis uses big data for this reason big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computeraided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance education a mckinsey global institute study found a shortage of 15 million highly trained data professionals and managers and a number of universities including university of tennessee and uc berkeley have created masters programs to meet this demand private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand including paid programs like the data incubator or general assembly in the specific field of marketing one of the problems stressed by wedel and kannan is that marketing has several sub domains eg advertising promotions product development branding that all use different types of data media to understand how the media uses big data it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process it has been suggested by nick couldry and joseph turow that practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals the industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers magazines or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations the ultimate aim is to serve or convey a message or content that is statistically speaking in line with the consumers mindset for example publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages advertisements and content articles to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various datamining activities targeting of consumers for advertising by marketers data capture data journalism publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics channel 4 the british publicservice television broadcaster is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis insurance health insurance providers are collecting data on social determinants of health such as food and tv consumption marital status clothing size and purchasing habits from which they make predictions on health costs in order to spot health issues in their clients it is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing internet of things iot big data and the iot work in conjunction data extracted from iot devices provides a mapping of device interconnectivity such mappings have been used by the media industry companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency the iot is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data and this sensory data has been used in medical manufacturing and transportation contexts kevin ashton the digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term defines the internet of things in this quote if we had computers that knew everything there was to know about thingsusing data they gathered without any help from uswe would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste loss and cost we would know when things needed replacing repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best information technology especially since 2015 big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology it the use of big data to resolve it and data collection issues within an enterprise is called it operations analytics itoa by applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing it departments can predict potential issues and prevent them itoa businesses offer platforms for systems management that bring data silos together and generate insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data survey science compared to surveybased data collection big data has low cost per data point applies analysis techniques via machine learning and data mining and includes diverse and new data sources eg registers social media apps and other forms digital data since 2018 survey scientists have started to examine how big data and survey science can complement each other to allow researchers and practitioners to improve the production of statistics and its quality there have been three big data meets survey science bigsurv conferences in 2018 2020 virtual 2023 and as of 2023 one conference forthcoming in 2025 a special issue in the social science computer review a special issue in journal of the royal statistical society and a special issue in ep j data science and a book called big data meets social sciences edited by craig hill and five other fellows of the american statistical association in 2021 the founding members of bigsurv received the warren j mitofsky innovators award from the american association for public opinion research marketing big data is notable in marketing due to the constant datafication of everyday consumers of the internet in which all forms of data are tracked the datafication of consumers can be defined as quantifying many of or all human behaviors for the purpose of marketing the increasingly digital world of rapid datafication makes this idea relevant to marketing because the amount of data constantly grows exponentially it is predicted to increase from 44 to 163 zettabytes within the span of five years the size of big data can often be difficult to navigate for marketers as a result adopters of big data may find themselves at a disadvantage algorithmic findings can be difficult to achieve with such large datasets big data in marketing is a highly lucrative tool that can be used for large corporations its value being as a result of the possibility of predicting significant trends interests or statistical outcomes in a consumerbased manner there are three significant factors in the use of big data in marketing big data provides customer behavior pattern spotting for marketers since all human actions are being quantified into readable numbers for marketers to analyze and use for their research in addition big data can also be seen as a customized product recommendation tool specifically since big data is effective in analyzing customers purchase behaviors and browsing patterns this technology can assist companies in promoting specific personalized products to specific customers realtime market responsiveness is important for marketers because of the ability to shift marketing efforts and correct to current trends which is helpful in maintaining relevance to consumers this can supply corporations with the information necessary to predict the wants and needs of consumers in advance datadriven market ambidexterity are being highly fueled by big data new models and algorithms are being developed to make significant predictions about certain economic and social situations case studies government china the integrated joint operations platform ijop is used by the government to monitor the population particularly uyghurs biometrics including dna samples are gathered through a program of free physicals by 2020 china plans to give all its citizens a personal social credit score based on how they behave the social credit system now being piloted in a number of chinese cities is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology india big data analysis was tried out for the bjp to win the 2014 indian general election the indian government uses numerous techniques to ascertain how the indian electorate is responding to government action as well as ideas for policy augmentation israel personalized diabetic treatments can be created through glucomes big data solution united kingdom examples of uses of big data in public services data on prescription drugs by connecting origin location and the time of each prescription a research unit was able to exemplify and examine the considerable delay between the release of any given drug and a ukwide adaptation of the national institute for health and care excellence guidelines this suggests that new or most uptodate drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient joining up data a local authority blended data about services such as road gritting rotas with services for people at risk such as meals on wheels the connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any weatherrelated delay united states in 2012 the obama administration announced the big data research and development initiative to explore how big data could be used to address important problems faced by the government the initiative is composed of 84 different big data programs spread across six departments big data analysis played a large role in barack obamas successful 2012 reelection campaign the united states federal government owns four of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world the utah data center has been constructed by the united states national security agency when finished the facility will be able to handle a large amount of information collected by the nsa over the internet the exact amount of storage space is unknown but more recent sources claim it will be on the order of a few exabytes this has posed security concerns regarding the anonymity of the data collected retail walmart handles more than 1 million customer transactions every hour which are imported into databases estimated to contain more than 25 petabytes 2560 terabytes of datathe equivalent of 167 times the information contained in all the books in the us library of congress windermere real estate uses location information from nearly 100 million drivers to help new home buyers determine their typical drive times to and from work throughout various times of the day fico card detection system protects accounts worldwide omnichannel retailing leverages online big data to improve offline experiences science the large hadron collider experiments represent about 150 million sensors delivering data 40 million times per second there are nearly 600 million collisions per second after filtering and refraining from recording more than 9999995 of these streams there are 1000 collisions of interest per second as a result only working with less than 0001 of the sensor stream data the data flow from all four lhc experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before replication as of 2012 this becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication if all sensor data were recorded in lhc the data flow would be extremely hard to work with the data flow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate or nearly 500 exabytes per day before replication to put the number in perspective this is equivalent to 500 quintillion 51020 bytes per day almost 200 times more than all the other sources combined in the world the square kilometre array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas it is expected to be operational by 2024 collectively these antennas are expected to gather 14 exabytes and store one petabyte per day it is considered one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever undertaken when the sloan digital sky survey sdss began to collect astronomical data in 2000 it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy previously continuing at a rate of about 200 gb per night sdss has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information when the large synoptic survey telescope successor to sdss comes online in 2020 its designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every five days decoding the human genome originally took 10 years to process now it can be achieved in less than a day the dna sequencers have divided the sequencing cost by 10000 in the last ten years which is 100 times less expensive than the reduction in cost predicted by moores law the nasa center for climate simulation nccs stores 32 petabytes of climate observations and simulations on the discover supercomputing cluster googles dnastack compiles and organizes dna samples of genetic data from around the world to identify diseases and other medical defects these fast and exact calculations eliminate any friction points or human errors that could be made by one of the numerous science and biology experts working with the dna dnastack a part of google genomics allows scientists to use the vast sample of resources from googles search server to scale social experiments that would usually take years instantly 23andmes dna database contains the genetic information of over 1000000 people worldwide the company explores selling the anonymous aggregated genetic data to other researchers and pharmaceutical companies for research purposes if patients give their consent ahmad hariri professor of psychology and neuroscience at duke university who has been using 23andme in his research since 2009 states that the most important aspect of the companys new service is that it makes genetic research accessible and relatively cheap for scientists a study that identified 15 genome sites linked to depression in 23andmes database lead to a surge in demands to access the repository with 23andme fielding nearly 20 requests to access the depression data in the two weeks after publication of the paper computational fluid dynamics cfd and hydrodynamic turbulence research generate massive data sets the johns hopkins turbulence databases jhtdb contains over 350 terabytes of spatiotemporal fields from direct numerical simulations of various turbulent flows such data have been difficult to share using traditional methods such as downloading flat simulation output files the data within jhtdb can be accessed using virtual sensors with various access modes ranging from direct webbrowser queries access through matlab python fortran and c programs executing on clients platforms to cut out services to download raw data the data have been used in over 150 scientific publications sports big data can be used to improve training and understanding competitors using sport sensors it is also possible to predict winners in a match using big data analytics future performance of players could be predicted as well thus players value and salary is determined by data collected throughout the season in formula one races race cars with hundreds of sensors generate terabytes of data these sensors collect data points from tire pressure to fuel burn efficiency based on the data engineers and data analysts decide whether adjustments should be made in order to win a race besides using big data race teams try to predict the time they will finish the race beforehand based on simulations using data collected over the season technology as of 2013 ebaycom uses two data warehouses at 75 petabytes and 40pb as well as a 40pb hadoop cluster for search consumer recommendations and merchandising amazoncom handles millions of backend operations every day as well as queries from more than half a million thirdparty sellers the core technology that keeps amazon running is linuxbased and as of 2005 they had the worlds three largest linux databases with capacities of 78 tb 185 tb and 247 tb facebook handles 50 billion photos from its user base as of june 2017 facebook reached 2 billion monthly active users google was handling roughly 100 billion searches per month as of august 2012 covid19 during the covid19 pandemic big data was raised as a way to minimise the impact of the disease significant applications of big data included minimising the spread of the virus case identification and development of medical treatment governments used big data to track infected people to minimise spread early adopters included china taiwan south korea and israel research activities encrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in march 2014 at the american society of engineering education gautam siwach engaged at tackling the challenges of big data by mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and amir esmailpour at the unh research group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections they focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and realtime examples within the technology moreover they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data in march 2012 the white house announced a national big data initiative that consisted of six federal departments and agencies committing more than 200 million to big data research projects the initiative included a national science foundation expeditions in computing grant of 10 million over five years to the amplab at the university of california berkeley the amplab also received funds from darpa and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion to fighting cancer the white house big data initiative also included a commitment by the department of energy to provide 25 million in funding over five years to establish the scalable data management analysis and visualization sdav institute led by the energy departments lawrence berkeley national laboratory the sdav institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the departments supercomputers the us state of massachusetts announced the massachusetts big data initiative in may 2012 which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions the massachusetts institute of technology hosts the intel science and technology center for big data in the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory combining government corporate and institutional funding and research efforts the european commission is funding the twoyearlong big data public private forum through their seventh framework program to engage companies academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues the project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the european commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy outcomes of this project will be used as input for horizon 2020 their next framework program the british government announced in march 2014 the founding of the alan turing institute named after the computer pioneer and codebreaker which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets at the university of waterloo stratford campus canadian open data experience code inspiration day participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world computational social sciences anyone can use application programming interfaces apis provided by big data holders such as google and twitter to do research in the social and behavioral sciences often these apis are provided for free tobias preis et al used google trends data to demonstrate that internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic products gdps are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past the findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviors and realworld economic indicators the authors of the study examined google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year 2011 to the volume of searches for the previous year 2009 which they call the future orientation index they compared the future orientation index to the per capita gdp of each country and found a strong tendency for countries where google users inquire more about the future to have a higher gdp tobias preis and his colleagues helen susannah moat and h eugene stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by google trends their analysis of google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance published in scientific reports suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist hence there is seen by some to be a need to fundamentally change the processing ways sampling big data a research question that is asked about big data sets is whether it is necessary to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or if is a sample is good enough the name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data but sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population in manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics vibration pressure current voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals to predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient big data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic psychographic behavioral and transactional data with large sets of data points marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting critique critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors those that question the implications of the approach itself and those that question the way it is currently done one approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies critiques of the big data paradigm a crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical microprocesses that lead to the emergence of these typical network characteristics of big data in their critique snijders matzat and reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of microprocesses mark graham has leveled broad critiques at chris andersons assertion that big data will spell the end of theory focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social economic and political contexts even as companies invest eight and ninefigure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers less than 40 of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so to overcome this insight deficit big data no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed must be complemented by big judgment according to an article in the harvard business review much in the same line it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably informed by the world as it was in the past or at best as it currently is fed by a large number of data on past experiences algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past if the systems dynamics of the future change if it is not a stationary process the past can say little about the future in order to make predictions in changing environments it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic which requires theory as a response to this critique alemany oliver and vayre suggest to use abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers digital traces and make new theories emerge additionally it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations such as agentbased models and complex systems agentbased models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms finally the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data such as factor analysis and cluster analysis have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bivariate approaches eg contingency tables typically employed with smaller data sets in health and biology conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation for these approaches the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis a new postulate is accepted now in biosciences the information provided by the data in huge volumes omics without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation in the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor the search logic is reversed and the limits of induction glory of science and philosophy scandal c d broad 1926 are to be considered privacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy the misuse of big data in several cases by media companies and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society barocas and nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected with whom it is shared under what constraints and for what purposes critiques of the v model the v model of big data is concerning as it centers around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information this led to the framework of cognitive big data which characterizes big data applications according to data completeness understanding of the nonobvious from data data correlation causation and predictability causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability explainability and interpretability humans desire to understand and accept what they understand where algorithms do not cope with this level of automated decisionmaking algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic selflearning critiques of novelty large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century including the us census analytics performed by ibms punchcard machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent in more recent decades science experiments such as cern have produced data on similar scales to current commercial big data however science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custombuilt highperformance computing supercomputing clusters and grids rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave implying a difference in both culture and technology stack critiques of big data execution ulfdietrich reips and uwe matzat wrote in 2014 that big data had become a fad in scientific research researcher danah boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data this approach may lead to results that have a bias in one way or another integration across heterogeneous data resourcessome that might be considered big data and others notpresents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science in the provocative article critical questions for big data the authors title big data a part of mythology large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge with the aura of truth objectivity and accuracy users of big data are often lost in the sheer volume of numbers and working with big data is still subjective and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth recent developments in bi domain such as proactive reporting especially target improvements in the usability of big data through automated filtering of nonuseful data and correlations big structures are full of spurious correlations either because of noncausal coincidences law of truly large numbers solely nature of big randomness ramsey theory or existence of nonincluded factors so the hope of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers speak for themselves and revolutionize scientific method is questioned catherine tucker has pointed to hype around big data writing by itself big data is unlikely to be valuable the article explains the many contexts where data is cheap relative to the cost of retaining talent to process it suggests that processing skills are more important than data itself in creating value for a firm big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets in many big data projects there is no large data analysis happening but the challenge is the extract transform load part of data preprocessing big data is a buzzword and a vague term but at the same time an obsession with entrepreneurs consultants scientists and the media big data showcases such as google flu trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two similarly academy awards and election predictions solely based on twitter were more often off than on target big data often poses the same challenges as small data adding more data does not solve problems of bias but may emphasize other problems in particular data sources such as twitter are not representative of the overall population and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions google translatewhich is based on big data statistical analysis of textdoes a good job at translating web pages however results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed on the other hand big data may also introduce new problems such as the multiple comparisons problem simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant ioannidis argued that most published research findings are false due to essentially the same effect when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments ie process a big amount of scientific data although not with big data technology the likelihood of a significant result being false grows fast even more so when only positive results are published furthermore big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated in an example big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 us presidential election with varying degrees of success critiques of big data policing and surveillance big data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations due to the less visible nature of databased surveillance as compared to traditional methods of policing objections to big data policing are less likely to arise according to sarah braynes big data surveillance the case of policing big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways placing people under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace thus creating obstacles to social inclusion if these potential problems are not corrected or regulated the effects of big data policing may continue to shape societal hierarchies conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases brayne also notes see also references bibliography hilbert m 2016 big data for development a review of promises and challenges development policy review
